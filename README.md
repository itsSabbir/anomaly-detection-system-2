# Anomaly Detection System 2 (Barebones ML Pipeline)

This project implements the core machine learning pipeline for an automated anomaly detection system. It focuses on video upload, processing via YOLOv5, anomaly detection based on custom rules, and storing alert information with relevant frame data.

This version prioritizes the core backend and ML functionality over extensive frontend features or test coverage, aiming for a clean and demonstrable pipeline suitable for assessment purposes.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
*   **ML Processing:** Python, OpenCV, YOLOv5 (PyTorch Hub), Pandas
*   **Frontend (Minimal):** React, TypeScript, Vite, Material UI (MUI), Axios
*   **Database:** AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
*   **Deployment:** AWS EC2

*(Further sections like Setup, Running, Deployment, etc., will be added later)*
