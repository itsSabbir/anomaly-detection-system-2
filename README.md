# Anomaly Detection System (Core ML Pipeline & Original Scope Considerations)

This project implements the core machine learning pipeline for an automated anomaly detection system. It has been developed through several stages, initially envisioning a broader scope as outlined in project requirements, and subsequently pivoting to focus on delivering a demonstrable end-to-end ML pipeline. The system's primary function is to receive video uploads, process them using a Python script leveraging YOLOv5 for object detection, apply custom rules to identify anomalies, and if an anomaly is detected, save the relevant video frame and store alert metadata in a PostgreSQL database (AWS RDS). The backend and ML processing components are designed for deployment on AWS EC2.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the system's architecture, setup, operation, deployment, key decisions made throughout its development (including alignment with initial requirements), detailed theoretical implementations for original scope items not fully realized in the current version, and plans for future enhancements. It is intended to be an exhaustive resource for understanding, operating, and extending the system.

## 1. Project Evolution & Objective Alignment

The central objective of this project, as stipulated by the assessment guidelines, is to "Evaluate the candidate's ability to design and implement a modular, ML-integrated anomaly detection system using a Node.js backend, with emphasis on core business logic, decoupling, and modern AI-assisted development (vibe coding)."

This project was undertaken with this precise objective at its core. While initial considerations explored a comprehensive feature set (as detailed retrospectively in Section 10: "Addressing Original Project Requirements"), a strategic decision was made early in the development lifecycle to **pivot to a "Barebones Core ML Pipeline" focus**. This deliberate shift was to ensure the delivery of a functional, demonstrable, and technically sound end-to-end system within the assessment's practical constraints.

Consequently, the development effort was concentrated on achieving the following key deliverables:

1.  **Robust Backend Infrastructure:** Establishment of a Node.js server using the Express.js framework, designed for clear orchestration of the detection pipeline.
2.  **Cloud Integration for Persistence & Deployment:** Successful integration with AWS services, specifically utilizing AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage of alert metadata and AWS EC2 for the deployment of all backend and ML processing components.
3.  **Functional Video Upload Mechanism:** Implementation of a minimal-viable frontend (React, TypeScript, MUI) to enable straightforward video file uploads by a user.
4.  **End-to-End ML Processing:** Successful execution of a Python script leveraging a pretrained YOLOv5 model for object detection within uploaded videos.
5.  **Custom Anomaly Rule Implementation:** Application of simple, clearly defined rules within the Python script to identify anomalies based on object detection results.
6.  **Persistent Artifact Storage:** Saving critical data upon anomaly detection, including structured alert metadata to the RDS database and the relevant video frame image to the EC2 server's local filesystem.
7.  **Demonstration of AI-Assisted Development:** Consistent application of "vibe coding" principles throughout the development lifecycle, leveraging AI tools for code generation, problem-solving, and refinement (detailed in Section 11).

The current implementation of the "Anomaly Detection System (Core ML Pipeline)" successfully delivers these focused objectives. It provides a strong, functional foundation and clearly showcases the ability to integrate disparate and complex technological components into a cohesive system.

This README meticulously documents the current state. Section 10, "Addressing Original Project Requirements," serves a dual purpose: it maps the current implementation back to the original full scope and, importantly, provides **detailed theoretical solution strategies and design considerations** for those original requirements that were intentionally de-scoped in this "barebones" iteration. This ensures that both the practical execution skills and a comprehensive understanding of the broader system vision are demonstrated, fully aligning with the primary evaluation objective.

## 3. System Architecture (Implemented Core Pipeline)

### 3.1 Conceptual Overview

The implemented system is a web-based application designed for automated anomaly detection in uploaded video files. It **`comprises`** a frontend for user interaction (video upload), a backend server for request handling and orchestration, a machine learning component for video analysis, and a database for persistent storage of detected anomalies. The core pipeline demonstrates an end-to-end flow from video upload to alert generation and storage.

### 3.2 Component Breakdown and Interactions

The system comprises several key components that interact to perform its functions:

1.  **Frontend (React with TypeScript & MUI):**
    *   **Role:** Provides a minimal User Interface (UI) for video uploads.
    *   **Functionality:** Allows users to select a video file from their local system and initiate the upload process to the backend. Displays status messages regarding the upload initiation and **`the backend's final processing outcome (e.g., success, error, anomaly found).`**
    *   **Interaction:** Communicates with the Backend API via HTTP POST requests (using Axios) to send video data.

2.  **Backend API (Node.js with Express.js):**
    *   **Role:** Serves as the central orchestrator, handling incoming requests, managing the ML processing pipeline, and interacting with the database.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Receives video uploads via a dedicated API endpoint (e.g., `/api/upload`).
        *   Temporarily stores the uploaded video file on the **`EC2 instance's`** filesystem (e.g., in `backend/uploads/`).
        *   Invokes the Python ML script as a child process, passing the video file path and an output path for frames.
        *   Receives processing results (JSON metadata of detected anomalies) and error information from the Python script via standard output/error streams.
        *   If anomalies are detected, it parses the metadata and inserts alert records into the PostgreSQL database.
        *   Manages and cleans up temporary video files.
        *   **`[KEEP if implemented]`** Provides a health check endpoint (e.g., `/api/health`). **`[REMOVE if not implemented]`**
        *   Serves static files (specifically, the saved anomaly frames from a designated directory like `backend/frames/`).
    *   **Interaction:**
        *   Listens for HTTP requests from the Frontend.
        *   Spawns and communicates with the Python ML Script.
        *   Executes SQL queries against the AWS RDS PostgreSQL Database.

3.  **Machine Learning Script (Python with YOLOv5 & OpenCV):**
    *   **Role:** Performs the core video analysis for object detection and anomaly identification.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Receives a video file path and an output directory path as command-line arguments from the Node.js backend.
        *   Utilizes OpenCV to read and process video frames.
        *   Employs a pretrained YOLOv5 model (loaded via PyTorch Hub **`or from a local .pt file`**) to detect objects in each (sampled) frame.
        *   Applies custom-defined rules to the detection results to identify anomalies (e.g., count of persons exceeding a threshold).
        *   If an anomaly is detected, it saves the specific video frame (containing the anomaly) as a JPEG image to the designated output directory.
        *   Outputs a JSON string to its standard output, containing metadata about the detected anomaly (e.g., `alert_type`, `message`, `frame_filename`, `details`).
        *   Outputs any errors or verbose logging to its standard error stream.
    *   **Interaction:** Invoked by and communicates (via stdin/stdout/stderr pipes) with the Backend API. Reads video files from and writes frame images to the EC2 instance's local filesystem.

4.  **Database (PostgreSQL on AWS RDS):**
    *   **Role:** Provides persistent storage for anomaly alert metadata.
    *   **Functionality:** Stores structured information about each detected anomaly, including a timestamp, alert type, descriptive message, a key/path to the saved frame, and other relevant details (JSONB for flexibility).
    *   **Interaction:** Accessed by the Backend API for writing new alert records.

5.  **Deployment Environment (AWS EC2):**
    *   **Role:** Hosts the Backend API and the Python ML Script. The EC2 instance's local filesystem is used for temporary video storage and persistent (in this version) frame image storage.
    *   **Interaction:** The Node.js application and Python script run within this environment. Network configurations (Security Groups) allow traffic to the application and from the application to the RDS database.

### 3.3 Data Flow

The primary data flow for an anomaly detection event is as follows:

1.  **Video Upload:**
    *   The User selects a video file via the Frontend UI.
    *   The Frontend sends an HTTP POST request containing the video file (multipart/form-data) to the Backend `/api/upload` endpoint.
2.  **Backend Reception & ML Invocation:**
    *   The Express.js server (with `multer`) receives the video file and saves it temporarily on the **`EC2 instance's`** local filesystem (e.g., in `backend/uploads/`).
    *   The Backend API spawns the `detect.py` Python script, passing the path to the temporary video file and the path to the `backend/frames/` directory (for output images).
3.  **ML Processing:**
    *   `detect.py` loads the YOLOv5 model.
    *   It opens the video file using OpenCV and iterates through frames (potentially sampling them).
    *   For each relevant frame, YOLOv5 performs object detection.
    *   Custom anomaly rules are applied to the detection results (e.g., "if more than 'X' persons detected").
4.  **Anomaly Handling & Frame Saving:**
    *   If an anomaly is detected according to the rules:
        *   The current video frame is saved as a JPEG image (e.g., `anomaly_frame_<timestamp>.jpg`) into the `backend/frames/` directory on the EC2 instance.
        *   `detect.py` constructs a JSON object containing `alert_type`, `message` (describing the anomaly), **`frame_filename` (which becomes the `frame_storage_key` in the database)**, and any other `details` (like detection counts).
        *   This JSON object is printed to the Python script's standard output.
5.  **Result Persistence:**
    *   The Node.js Backend captures the standard output from `detect.py`.
    *   It parses the JSON string.
    *   The Backend constructs an SQL INSERT query with the parsed alert metadata.
    *   This query is executed against the `alerts` table in the AWS RDS PostgreSQL database, storing the alert record.
6.  **Cleanup & Response:**
    *   The Backend deletes the temporary uploaded video file from `backend/uploads/`.
    *   The Backend sends an HTTP response (e.g., 200 OK with a success message **`or 201 Created with alert details if an anomaly was found`**) back to the Frontend.
7.  **User Feedback:**
    *   The Frontend receives the response and updates the UI to inform the user of the outcome (e.g., "Upload successful, anomaly detected and logged," or "No anomalies detected," or an error message).

### 3.4 Key Design Principles

*   **Modularity:** Separation of concerns is maintained:
    *   Frontend for presentation.
    *   Backend for orchestration and business logic.
    *   Python script dedicated to ML processing.
    *   Database for persistent storage.
*   **Decoupling (Partial):**
    *   The ML processing is invoked as a separate process, allowing the Node.js backend to remain non-blocking for ML computations.
    *   The database interaction is encapsulated in a `db.js` module.
*   **Statelessness (Backend API):** The backend API itself aims to be stateless where possible, with state primarily managed in the database (alert data) or client-side (UI state). Session management is not part of the current core scope.
*   **Focus on Core Pipeline:** The architecture prioritizes a functional end-to-end flow for the primary use case.

  
## 4. Technology Stack

The system leverages a range of modern technologies chosen for their suitability to the task, developer productivity, and ecosystem support.

### 4.1 Frontend

*   **React (v18.x):** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   *Why:* Component-based architecture, strong community, vast ecosystem, declarative programming model makes UI development manageable.

*   **Material-UI (MUI) (v5.x):** A comprehensive suite of React UI components that implement Google's Material Design.
    *   *Why:* Provides pre-built, customizable, and accessible components, accelerating UI development and ensuring a consistent look and feel. Used for the minimal upload interface, **`specifically for layout (`Container`, `Paper`, `Box`), user feedback (`Button`, `Typography`, `LinearProgress`, `Alert`), and icons (`CloudUploadIcon`).`**
*   **Vite (v5.x):** A modern frontend build tool that provides an extremely fast development server and optimized builds.
    *   *Why:* Significantly improves the developer experience with near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and efficient production bundling **`(via npm run build)`**.
*   **Axios (v1.x):** A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
    *   *Why:* Simplifies making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API, with features like request/response interception, data transformation, **`and robust error handling.`**

### 4.2 Backend

*   **Node.js (v18.x / v20.x recommended):** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
    *   *Why:* Allows for full-stack JavaScript development, excellent for I/O-bound applications, large package ecosystem (npm), and asynchronous non-blocking nature suits API development **`and I/O heavy tasks like file handling and orchestrating child processes.`**
*   **Express.js (v4.x):** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
    *   *Why:* Provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications (routing, middleware, request handling) without being overly opinionated.
*   **`pg` (node-postgres) (v8.x):** Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
    *   *Why:* The standard and well-maintained library for interacting with PostgreSQL databases from Node.js, offering connection pooling **`(managed by the Pool class)`** and support for various query types, **`including parameterized queries for security against SQL injection.`**
*   **`multer` (v1.x):** Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for file uploads.
    *   *Why:* Simplifies the process of **`securely`** receiving uploaded files in Express.js applications.
*   **`dotenv` (v16.x):** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
    *   *Why:* Facilitates managing configuration settings (like database credentials, API keys) securely and separately for different environments (development, production), **`with sensitive information stored in the .env file, which is excluded from version control.`**
*   **`cors` (v2.x):** Node.js CORS middleware.
    *   *Why:* Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, necessary when the frontend and backend are served from different origins (ports or domains) during development or deployment.

### 4.3 Machine Learning

    *   *Why:* Offers a good balance of speed and accuracy for object detection tasks. Pretrained models are easily accessible (**`e.g., yolov5s.pt used in this project`**), aligning with the project's focus on integration rather than model training.
*   **OpenCV (opencv-python) (v4.x):** An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
    *   *Why:* Essential for video processing tasks like reading frames from a video file, image manipulation (e.g., resizing if needed, **`saving frames as JPEGs`**), and basic image processing operations required before or after ML model inference.

### 4.4 Database

*   **PostgreSQL (v14.x+ on RDS):** A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
    *   *Why:* Known for its reliability, feature robustness (including strong support for JSON/JSONB data types), extensibility, and SQL compliance. JSONB is particularly useful for storing flexible `details` about alerts **`without requiring schema changes for varied metadata.`**
*   **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service):** A managed database service by Amazon Web Services.
    *   *Why:* Simplifies database setup, operation, and scaling. Handles routine tasks like patching, backups, and provides options for high availability and security.

    *   *Why:* Essential for source code management, collaboration, tracking changes, and maintaining project history.
*   **ESLint (v8.x/v9.x):** A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript.
    *   *Why:* Enforces code quality, maintains consistent coding style, and helps catch potential errors and bad practices early. **`Specific TypeScript rules are used (e.g., @typescript-eslint/recommended, eslint-plugin-react for frontend; eslint-config-standard for backend).`**
*   **Jest (v29.x):** A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
    *   *Why:* Used for unit and integration testing of both frontend (React components with React Testing Library) and backend (Node.js modules and API endpoints with Supertest) code. Supports mocking, assertions, and code coverage reporting **`(though extensive test coverage was de-scoped in the pivoted barebones version, the framework is set up for future expansion)`**.
*   **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A popular source-code editor.
    *   *Why:* Excellent support for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, debugging, Git integration, and a vast library of extensions that enhance developer productivity.

## 5. Project Structure

The project is organized into a monorepo-like structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend components, promoting modularity and independent development where possible.

```

**Key Directory and File Explanations:**

*   **`backend/`**: Contains all server-side code.
    *   **`db.js`**: Manages the PostgreSQL connection pool and provides a unified query function. Essential for decoupling database logic.
    *   **`db_schema.sql`**: Defines the structure of the `alerts` table. This script needs to be run once on the RDS database to set up the necessary table.
    *   **`frames/`**: On the EC2 server, this directory will store the JPEG images of video frames where anomalies were detected. Express.js is configured to serve files from this directory.
    *   **`python/detect.py`**: The core ML script. It's invoked by `server.js` to process videos.
    *   **`python/requirements.txt`**: Lists Python packages (PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.) required by `detect.py`.
    *   **`server.js`**: The heart of the backend. It sets up the Express server, defines API routes (like `/api/upload`, `/api/health`), handles file uploads with `multer`, spawns the Python script, and interacts with `db.js` to store alerts.
    *   **`uploads/`**: A temporary holding area for video files uploaded by users before they are processed by the Python script. Files here are deleted after processing.
    *   **`.env.example`**: Template for backend environment variables (database credentials, port, etc.). A `.env` file must be created from this.
*   **`frontend/`**: Contains all client-side code for the React application.
    *   **`src/App.tsx`**: The main application component that orchestrates the UI.
    *   **`src/components/UploadSection.tsx`**: The React component responsible for the video upload interface.
    *   **`src/main.tsx`**: The entry point where the React application is bootstrapped and rendered into the `index.html`.
    *   **`vite.config.ts`**: Configuration for the Vite build tool, defining how the frontend is developed and built.
    *   **`.env.example`**: Template for frontend environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).
*   **`README.md`**: This file, providing detailed documentation.

## 6. Detailed Setup and Installation

This section provides comprehensive, step-by-step instructions to set up the development environment for both the backend and frontend, configure the necessary AWS services (RDS and preparation for EC2), and prepare the application for local execution. Following these steps meticulously will ensure a functional development setup.

### 6.1 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your development machine and any planned deployment environments meet the following prerequisites:

*   **Node.js and npm:**
    *   **Version:** Node.js v18.x (LTS) or v20.x (LTS) is strongly recommended for compatibility and long-term support.
    *   **Installation:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js.
    *   **Verification:** `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
*   **Python:**
    *   **Version:** Python v3.9 or newer (e.g., 3.10, 3.11).
    *   **Installation:** Download from [python.org](https://python.org/).
    *   **Essentials:** Ensure `pip` (Python package installer) and the `venv` module (for creating virtual environments) are available. These are usually included with standard Python distributions.
    *   **Verification:** `python3 --version` (or `python --version`) and `pip3 --version` (or `pip --version`).
*   **Git:**
    *   **Installation:** A modern version of Git. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
    *   **Verification:** `git --version`.
*   **AWS Account:**
    *   An active Amazon Web Services account. The project is designed to leverage the AWS Free Tier where possible for EC2 and RDS. Sign up at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/).
*   **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface):**
    *   **Highly Recommended** (though not strictly mandatory if all AWS setup is done via the console). It simplifies programmatic interaction with AWS.
    *   **Installation:** Follow the [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
    *   **Verification:** `aws --version`.
*   **Text Editor / IDE:**
    *   A code editor such as Visual Studio Code (recommended for its excellent JavaScript/TypeScript/Python support and integrated terminal), Sublime Text, or Atom.
*   **PostgreSQL Client (Optional but Highly Recommended):**
    *   A tool to interact directly with your PostgreSQL database for schema setup, data verification, and troubleshooting.
        *   **Command-Line:** `psql` (often installed with a local PostgreSQL server installation, or available as a standalone client).
        *   **GUI Tools:** pgAdmin (official PostgreSQL administration platform), DBeaver (free multi-platform database tool), DataGrip (JetBrains IDE).

### 6.2 AWS Account and CLI Configuration

Proper AWS configuration is foundational for interacting with RDS and EC2.

1.  **Sign Up/Log In to AWS Account:** Access the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2.  **IAM User Best Practice:**
    *   **AVOID using your AWS root account credentials for daily development or CLI access.**
    *   Create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with the necessary permissions (e.g., policies allowing creation/management of EC2 and RDS instances, and S3 if you extend to S3 storage). For initial project setup, an IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` policy (used cautiously) might be employed, but for ongoing work or more secure setups, craft a policy with only the required permissions.
3.  **Configure AWS CLI (If Installed):**
    *   Open your terminal/command prompt.
    *   Execute: `aws configure`
    *   You will be prompted for:
        *   `AWS Access Key ID`: Enter the Access Key ID for your IAM user.
        *   `AWS Secret Access Key`: Enter the Secret Access Key for your IAM user. **Treat this like a password.**
        *   `Default region name`: Enter the AWS region you will primarily use (e.g., `ca-central-1` for Canada Central, `us-east-1` for N. Virginia). This project setup often assumes `ca-central-1`.
        *   `Default output format`: `json` is a common and useful default.
    *   These credentials will be stored locally (typically in `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`).

### 6.3 Repository Cloning

1.  **Open your terminal (e.g., Git Bash on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).**
2.  **Navigate to your desired development directory** (e.g., `cd ~/Projects` or `cd C:\Users\YourUser\Development`).
3.  **Clone the Project Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SabbirHossain07/anomaly-detection-system-2.git
    cd anomaly-detection-system-2
    ```
    *(This assumes you are cloning your specific repository. Replace the URL if needed.)*

### 6.4 AWS RDS PostgreSQL Database Setup

The backend stores alert metadata in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS.

#### 6.4.1 Creating the RDS Instance (Production-Minded Detail)

1.  **Navigate to RDS Console:** Log in to the AWS Management Console. Select your preferred region (e.g., `ca-central-1`). Search for "RDS" and go to the dashboard.
2.  **Launch DB Instance:** Click "Create database".
    *   **Creation Method:** Choose "Standard Create".
    *   **Engine Options:**
        *   **Engine type:** `PostgreSQL`.
        *   **Version:** Select a stable, recent PostgreSQL version supported by the Free Tier (e.g., PostgreSQL 14.x, 15.x). Check Free Tier eligibility if cost is a concern.
    *   **Templates:** Select **"Free tier"**. This pre-selects instance class, storage type, and disables some paid features to help stay within free usage limits. If "Free tier" is unavailable, manually select Free Tier eligible options:
        *   **DB instance class:** e.g., `db.t3.micro` or `db.t2.micro`.
        *   **Storage type:** General Purpose SSD (gp2 or gp3).
        *   **Allocated storage:** 20 GiB (standard for Free Tier).
        *   Disable "Storage autoscaling".
    *   **Settings:**
        *   **DB instance identifier:** A unique name for your RDS instance within your AWS account and region (e.g., `anomaly-db-prod` or `anomaly-db-dev`). Example for this project: `anomaly-db-instance`.
        *   **Master username:** Choose a secure username (e.g., `anomaly_admin`). **Avoid using `postgres` directly**, as it can have system-level implications.
        *   **Master password:** Create a strong, unique password. Confirm it. **Store this password securely in a password manager.**
    *   **Connectivity:**
        *   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Select your default VPC or a specific one.
        *   **DB subnet group:** Usually, the default `default-vpc-<...>` is fine. Ensure it spans multiple Availability Zones for resilience (default RDS setup usually handles this).
        *   **Public access:** Set to **"Yes"**. This is crucial for simplified setup allowing your local machine (for development and schema setup) and later your EC2 instance to connect *over the internet*. For high-security production, this would be "No" with private networking (VPC Endpoints, Peering), but "Yes" with tight Security Groups is acceptable for this project's scope.
        *   **VPC security group (firewall):**
            *   Choose **"Create new"**.
            *   **New VPC security group name:** e.g., `anomaly-rds-sg`.
            *   **Availability Zone:** "No preference" is fine.
        *   **Database port:** Keep the default `5432` for PostgreSQL.
    *   **Database Authentication:** Select "Password authentication".
    *   **Additional Configuration (Expand if necessary):**
        *   **Initial database name:** Enter the name for the specific database the application will use (e.g., `anomalydb`). **This is the value for `DB_NAME` in your backend `.env` file.** If left blank, you might need to connect and create it manually using `CREATE DATABASE anomalydb;` with your master user.
        *   **Backup:** Free Tier might limit retention. Default (e.g., 7 days) is usually enabled.
        *   **Monitoring, Logging, Maintenance:** Review defaults. Minimal settings are fine. Disable "Enable performance insights" to stay within free tier if offered.
3.  **Create Database:** Review the "Estimated monthly costs" (should be $0.00 if fully within Free Tier). Click "Create database". Provisioning may take 10-20 minutes. Wait for the instance status to become **"Available"**.

#### 6.4.2 Configuring Security Groups for RDS (Critical for Connectivity)

Once the RDS instance status is "Available":

1.  **Locate Endpoint and Port:**
    *   In the RDS console, select your database instance.
    *   On the "Connectivity & security" tab, copy the **Endpoint name** (e.g., `anomaly-db-instance.xxxxxxxxxxxx.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com`) and verify the **Port** is `5432`. These are for `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` in `backend/.env`.
2.  **Configure Inbound Rules for `anomaly-rds-sg`:**
    *   Click the link to the VPC security group (e.g., `anomaly-rds-sg`) associated with your RDS instance.
    *   Select the "Inbound rules" tab and click "Edit inbound rules".
    *   **Rule 1: For Local Development & Schema Setup:**
        *   Click "Add rule".
        *   **Type:** `PostgreSQL`.
        *   **Protocol:** `TCP`.
        *   **Port range:** `5432`.
        *   **Source:** Select `My IP`. AWS auto-fills your current public IPv4 address.
        *   **Description:** e.g., `Allow PSQL from Local Dev IP (YYYY-MM-DD)`. *(If your IP is dynamic, you'll need to update this whenever it changes).*
    *   **Rule 2: For Deployed EC2 Backend (to be added later or pre-configured):**
        *   *Later (Section 9)*, you'll create a security group for your EC2 instance (e.g., `anomaly-ec2-sg`). You will then add another rule here:
            *   **Type:** `PostgreSQL`.
            *   **Source:** Select `Custom` and enter the **Security Group ID** of `anomaly-ec2-sg`.
            *   **Description:** e.g., `Allow PSQL from anomaly-ec2-sg`.
        *   *Alternative (less secure, simpler for immediate setup):* If you know your EC2's future public IP, you could add it now. But using SG ID is preferred.
    *   **Save rules.**

#### 6.4.3 Database Schema Initialization

The SQL script `backend/db_schema.sql` defines the `alerts` table.

1.  **Locate `backend/db_schema.sql`:** This file is in your cloned project repository.
    ```sql
    -- backend/db_schema.sql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS alerts (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
        alert_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        message TEXT,
        frame_storage_key VARCHAR(1024) UNIQUE, -- Ensure frame keys are unique
        details JSONB
    );

    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_alerts_timestamp ON alerts (timestamp DESC);
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_alerts_alert_type ON alerts (alert_type);
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_alerts_frame_key ON alerts (frame_storage_key);
    ```
    *(Note: Added `NOT NULL` to timestamp and alert_type, and an index on `frame_storage_key` which should also be unique).*
2.  **Connect to RDS and Execute Script:**
    *   **Using `psql` (from your local machine, assuming IP is allowed by SG):**
        ```bash
        psql --host=<YOUR_RDS_ENDPOINT> \
             --port=5432 \
             --username=<YOUR_MASTER_USERNAME> \
             --dbname=<YOUR_INITIAL_DATABASE_NAME_e.g_anomalydb> \
             -f /path/to/your/project/backend/db_schema.sql
        ```
        Enter your master password when prompted.
    *   **Using a GUI Tool (DBeaver, pgAdmin):** Connect to the RDS instance using the credentials. Open an SQL editor, paste the content of `db_schema.sql`, and execute it against your target database (e.g., `anomalydb`).
3.  **Verify Schema:**
    *   Using `psql` or GUI tool, connect to the database and run `\dt` (psql) or check the tables list. You should see the `alerts` table. Inspect its columns with `\d alerts` (psql).

### 6.5 Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory of the project: `cd /path/to/anomaly-detection-system-2/backend`.

#### 6.5.1 Node.js and npm Verification

Confirm Node.js and npm are correctly installed and meet version requirements (see 6.1).

#### 6.5.2 Environment Configuration (`backend/.env` file)

1.  In the `backend/` directory, copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  **Crucially edit `backend/.env`** with your actual AWS RDS credentials and paths:
    ```dotenv
    # backend/.env (Fill with YOUR actual values)
    PORT=3001

    # --- Database Configuration ---
    DB_HOST=your_rds_instance_endpoint.xxxxxxxx.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_USER=your_rds_master_username # e.g., anomaly_admin
    DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_RDS_MASTER_PASSWORD_HERE
    DB_NAME=anomalydb # The 'Initial database name' you set in RDS
    DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false # For dev. Set to true for prod with CA.

    # --- Python Script Configuration ---
    # Option 1: Rely on venv being activated where Node.js is run, or Python in PATH
    PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH=python3 # Or just 'python'
    # Option 2: Absolute path into your venv (RECOMMENDED FOR CONSISTENCY)
    # On Linux/macOS (adjust actual path to your project):
    # PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/path/to/anomaly-detection-system-2/backend/python/venv/bin/python3
    # On Windows (adjust actual path to your project):
    # PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH=C:\\path\\to\\anomaly-detection-system-2\\backend\\python\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe

    PYTHON_SCRIPT_PATH=./python/detect.py # Relative to backend directory execution
    # Note: Node.js server.js uses path.join(__dirname, 'python', 'detect.py'),
    # so PYTHON_SCRIPT_PATH from .env is more for if you call detect.py via shell script directly,
    # or if you modify server.js to read it.
    # For robustness, server.js itself constructs the path relative to __dirname.

    FRAMES_OUTPUT_DIR=./frames # Node.js will create this if it doesn't exist relative to __dirname
    UPLOADS_DIR=./uploads     # Node.js will create this if it doesn't exist relative to __dirname
    ```
    **Detailed Explanation for `.env` values:**
    *   Use the **exact Endpoint, User, Password, and DB Name from your RDS setup**.
    *   `DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false`: Simplifies local development by not strictly validating the SSL certificate authority against your local trust store (AWS RDS still uses SSL). For production, set to `true` and manage CA certificates appropriately.
    *   `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH`: If you want `server.js` to *always* use the Python from your project's virtual environment (recommended), provide the absolute path to `python`/`python3` inside `backend/python/venv/bin/` (Linux/macOS) or `backend/python/venv/Scripts/` (Windows). Otherwise, `python3` or `python` relies on the system's PATH or an activated venv in the terminal where `npm run dev` is executed.

#### 6.5.3 Python Virtual Environment and Dependencies

This isolates Python packages for the ML script.

1.  **Navigate to `backend/python/`:**
    ```bash
    cd python
    ```
2.  **Create Virtual Environment (if not already present from project setup):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv # Creates a 'venv' subdirectory
    ```
3.  **Activate Virtual Environment:**
    *   Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   Windows (Git Bash): `source venv/Scripts/activate`
    *   Windows (CMD/PowerShell): `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat` or `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)`.
4.  **Install Dependencies from `backend/python/requirements.txt`:**
    The `requirements.txt` should look similar to this (specify exact versions if known from successful local setup):
    ```
    # backend/python/requirements.txt
    torch~=2.0.0
    torchvision~=0.15.0
    # torchaudio # Only if needed by your specific PyTorch setup for other tasks
    opencv-python-headless~=4.7.0
    pandas~=2.0.0
    # yolov5 package (if installing directly via pip instead of torch.hub internal management)
    # If yolov5 is pip installed, torch.hub might still manage its own cache
    # but pip install ensures its command-line tools are available if needed.
    # This line might be 'yolov5' or a git+https URL for specific commit.
    # For torch.hub usage as in current detect.py, explicit pip install of yolov5 package might not be strictly needed,
    # as torch.hub manages the download and caching of 'ultralytics/yolov5'.
    # However, including it can help define the intended YOLOv5 ecosystem components.
    yolov5~=7.0
    ```
    Install with:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(This may take time, especially for PyTorch).*
5.  **(Crucial) Place/Verify `yolov5s.pt`:** If your `detect.py` loads the model from a local file (e.g., `model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', path='yolov5s.pt', ...)`), ensure `yolov5s.pt` is present in `backend/python/`. If `detect.py` uses `path='yolov5s'` (not a file path), `torch.hub` will download and cache it automatically on first run. Your `detect.py` is written to be flexible, favoring `torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', path=args.model, ...)` which supports both local path and hub name.
6.  **Deactivate (Optional for now):** You can `deactivate` the venv. When `npm run dev` starts `server.js`, if `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH` in `.env` is correctly set to the venv's Python, that specific interpreter will be used.

#### 6.5.4 Installing Backend Dependencies and Running Locally

1.  **Navigate to `backend/` directory** (if you were in `python/`):
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run Linter (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
    Address any reported issues.
4.  **Start Backend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Observe terminal output. You must see:
    *   `Server listening on port <PORT_FROM_ENV>`
    *   `[DB] Connection Test OK: <current_timestamp_from_db>`
    If DB connection fails, re-check all items in Section 6.7.

### 6.6 Frontend Setup (Minimal UI)

Navigate to the `frontend` directory of the project: `cd ../frontend` (if in `backend/`).

#### 6.6.1 Environment Configuration (`frontend/.env.development`)

1.  Ensure a file named `.env.development` exists in the `frontend/` directory.
2.  Its content should be:
    ```dotenv
    # frontend/.env.development
    # This URL is used by Vite during local development (`npm run dev`)
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
    ```
    *   `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Points to your local backend. When building for production deployment (Section 9), you'll create a `.env.production` or set build-time environment variables pointing to the deployed backend URL.

#### 6.6.2 Installing Frontend Dependencies and Running Locally

1.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run Linter (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
    Address any reported issues based on your `eslint.config.js`.
3.  **Start Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Vite will start and provide a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### 6.7 Initial Database Connection Troubleshooting Insights (Expanded)

If the backend (`npm run dev`) fails with database connection errors (especially `ETIMEDOUT` or authentication failures):

*   **Primary Suspect: RDS Security Group Inbound Rule:**
    1.  **Verify Your Current Public IP:** Google "what is my IP".
    2.  **Compare with AWS:** In RDS Console -> Your Instance -> Connectivity & security -> VPC security groups -> Click SG -> Inbound rules.
    3.  **Ensure rule exists:** Type `PostgreSQL`, Port `5432`, Source `YOUR_CURRENT_IP/32`. If not, add it with "Source: My IP".
    4.  **Wait 1 minute** for AWS to apply changes.
*   **Incorrect `backend/.env` Values:**
    *   `DB_HOST`: **Exactly** match the RDS "Endpoint".
    *   `DB_PORT`: Must be `5432`.
    *   `DB_USER`: Must match the RDS "Master username".
    *   `DB_PASSWORD`: Case-sensitive. Check for special characters that might need escaping if not quoted, though dotenv usually handles this.
    *   `DB_NAME`: Must be the "Initial database name" specified or created in RDS.
*   **RDS Instance Not "Available":** Check status in AWS Console. It must be "Available".
*   **SSL Configuration (`DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` in `backend/.env` and `ssl` options in `backend/db.js`):**
    *   Your `backend/db.js` code has: `ssl: process.env.DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED === 'true' ? { rejectUnauthorized: true } : { rejectUnauthorized: false }`.
    *   Ensure `DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false` in your `backend/.env` for local development for easier setup. This tells `node-postgres` not to fail if it can't validate the RDS server's SSL certificate against its system's CA store. The connection to RDS *will still be SSL encrypted*.
    *   If set to `true`, and your Node.js environment can't verify the AWS RDS CA, it will fail. This is more secure for production if CA certs are managed.
*   **VPC Network ACLs (NACLs):**
    *   These are stateless firewalls at the subnet level in your VPC.
    *   Default NACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic.
    *   If custom NACLs are in place, ensure they allow:
        *   **Inbound** to RDS subnet on TCP port 5432 from your source (e.g., your IP for local dev, EC2's IP range for deployed).
        *   **Outbound** from RDS subnet on ephemeral ports (TCP 1024-65535) to your source for the return traffic.
*   **Local Machine's Firewall (Windows Firewall, macOS Firewall, Antivirus):**
    *   Temporarily disable these to test if they are blocking outbound connections from Node.js on port 5432. **Remember to re-enable immediately.**
    *   If this is the cause, add an explicit outbound rule to allow `node.exe` (or Node.js in general) to make connections on port 5432.
*   **VPN / Proxy / Corporate Network:**
    *   If using a VPN, it changes your public IP. Update RDS SG accordingly.
    *   Proxies or restrictive corporate firewalls might block arbitrary TCP connections to port 5432. Test from a different network if possible.
*   **DNS Resolution:**
    *   Can your machine resolve the `DB_HOST` endpoint? Try: `ping <your_rds_instance_endpoint>` (ping might be blocked by AWS, but DNS resolution failure would show). `nslookup <your_rds_instance_endpoint>` might be more telling for DNS.
*   **`pg` library version:** While generally stable, ensure your `pg` version in `backend/package.json` is a recent, stable one (e.g., `^8.11.0` or higher).

By following these detailed steps, the development environment should be correctly configured, setting a solid foundation for running, testing, and eventually deploying the application.

## 7. Running the Application Locally

After completing the setup steps, you can run the application locally for development and testing.

### 7.1 Starting the Backend Server

1.  Open a terminal window.
2.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/project/anomaly-detection-system/backend
    ```
3.  Ensure your Python virtual environment (if you chose to specify its Python executable in `.env`) contains the necessary dependencies (`pip install -r python/requirements.txt` from within the activated venv or globally if not using venv and relying on system Python).
4.  Start the backend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server should start, connect to the database, and listen on the port specified in `backend/.env` (default: `3001`).

### 7.2 Starting the Frontend Development Server

1.  Open a *new* terminal window (keep the backend server running).
2.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/project/anomaly-detection-system/frontend
    ```
3.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Vite will compile the app and make it available, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. The terminal will display the exact URL.

### 7.3 Accessing the Application

1.  Open a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended).
2.  Navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
3.  You should see the minimal UI for video upload. You can now test the end-to-end pipeline locally.

## 8. Testing and Verification

Thorough testing is crucial. This project relies on manual end-to-end testing for the core pipeline and a utility script for specific backend verification.

### 8.1 Manual End-to-End Testing Procedure

This procedure verifies the core functionality: video upload, anomaly detection, frame saving, and database logging.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Backend server is running locally (or on EC2).
    *   Frontend development server is running locally (or frontend is built and served if testing deployed version).
    *   AWS RDS PostgreSQL database is accessible and the `alerts` table exists.
    *   Have a sample video file ready (e.g., a short MP4 clip). Ideally, have one video that *should* trigger the anomaly (e.g., multiple people if that's the rule) and one that *should not*.
2.  **Steps:**
    *   **Access the Frontend:** Open the application in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
    *   **Select Video File:**
        *   Click the "Choose File" (or similar) button in the `UploadSection` component.
        *   Select your sample video file.
    *   **Upload Video:**
        *   Click the "Upload Video" button.
    *   **Monitor Frontend:**
        *   Observe status messages displayed on the frontend. It should indicate "Uploading...", then "Processing...", and finally a success or error message.
        *   Check the browser's developer console (Network tab and Console tab) for any HTTP errors or client-side JavaScript errors.
    *   **Monitor Backend Logs:**
        *   Observe the terminal where your backend server (`npm run dev`) is running.
        *   Look for log messages indicating:
            *   File received.
            *   Python script invocation.
            *   `stdout` (JSON output) and `stderr` (logs/errors) from the Python script.
            *   Database insertion attempt and success/failure.
            *   Temporary file deletion.
    *   **Check `backend/frames/` Directory (if anomaly detected):**
        *   If the Python script detected an anomaly and saved a frame, navigate to the `backend/frames/` directory on your local machine (or EC2 instance if deployed).
        *   Verify that a new JPEG image file has been created. The filename should match the `frame_storage_key` logged by the backend and stored in the database.
        *   Open the image to confirm it's the correct frame from the video where the anomaly occurred.
    *   **Check Database:**
        *   Connect to your AWS RDS PostgreSQL database using `psql` or a GUI tool.
        *   Query the `alerts` table:
            ```sql
            SELECT * FROM alerts ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;
            ```
        *   If an anomaly was detected and processed successfully by the backend, a new row should exist in the `alerts` table.
        *   Verify the `timestamp`, `alert_type`, `message`, `frame_storage_key`, and `details` (JSONB content) fields are populated correctly and match the detected anomaly. The `frame_storage_key` should correspond to the filename in the `frames/` directory.
    *   **Check `backend/uploads/` Directory:**
        *   Verify that the temporary uploaded video file has been deleted from the `backend/uploads/` directory after processing.
3.  **Repeat Testing:**
    *   Test with a video that *should not* trigger an anomaly. Verify no frame is saved and no alert is logged in the database. The frontend should report accordingly.
    *   Test with various video formats (if `detect.py` supports them) or edge cases (very short video, very large video if constraints exist).

### 8.2 Automated Pipeline Test Script (`test_pipeline_detailed.sh`)

The `backend/test_pipeline_detailed.sh` script is a utility to perform a more direct test of the backend's video processing pipeline, bypassing the frontend UI.

1.  **Purpose:**
    *   To simulate a file upload directly to the backend `/api/upload` endpoint using `curl`.
    *   To verify that the backend correctly invokes the Python script and processes its output.
    *   To check if an alert record is created in the database for a known-to-be-anomalous video.
2.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   The backend server must be running.
    *   `curl` and `jq` (command-line JSON processor) must be installed on the machine running the script.
    *   A sample video file (e.g., `sample_video.mp4`) must exist in the `backend/` directory (or modify the script to point to its location). This video should ideally be one that is known to trigger the anomaly detection logic in `detect.py`.
    *   The `DB_` environment variables for database connection must be accessible to `psql` if the script includes database verification steps.
3.  **How to Run:**
    *   Open a terminal in the `backend/` directory.
    *   Make the script executable: `chmod +x test_pipeline_detailed.sh`
    *   Run the script: `./test_pipeline_detailed.sh`
4.  **Expected Behavior and Output:**
    *   The script will use `curl` to send a POST request with the sample video to `http://localhost:3001/api/upload`.
    *   It will print the HTTP response from the server.
    *   It might include `jq` commands to parse the JSON response if applicable.
    *   If the script includes database checks, it might use `psql` to query the `alerts` table and verify that a new record corresponding to the test video has been created.
    *   The script should clearly indicate whether the test passed or failed based on the server's response and any subsequent checks.
    *   Check `backend/frames/` and the database manually as well to confirm the script's assertions.
5.  **Customization:**
    *   You may need to modify the script:
        *   To point to the correct sample video file.
        *   To adjust `curl` parameters if your API endpoint changes.
        *   To enhance database verification steps (e.g., checking specific fields of the newly created alert).

    *Example snippet from a conceptual `test_pipeline_detailed.sh`*:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Basic pipeline test script

    VIDEO_FILE="sample_video_with_anomaly.mp4" # Ensure this file exists and causes an anomaly
    UPLOAD_URL="http://localhost:3001/api/upload"
    FRAMES_DIR="./frames"
    EXPECTED_ALERT_TYPE="Multiple_Persons_Detected" # Example

    echo "Testing anomaly detection pipeline..."
    # Create a dummy sample video if it doesn't exist (for placeholder)
    # touch $VIDEO_FILE

    # Get initial count of alerts and frames
    INITIAL_ALERT_COUNT=$(psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alerts;" | xargs)
    # ... (similar for frames if needed)

    echo "Uploading $VIDEO_FILE to $UPLOAD_URL..."
    RESPONSE_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -F "video=@$VIDEO_FILE" $UPLOAD_URL)

    if [ "$RESPONSE_CODE" -eq 200 ] || [ "$RESPONSE_CODE" -eq 201 ]; then
        echo "Upload successful with HTTP status: $RESPONSE_CODE"

        # Verify alert in DB
        # This is a simplified check; more robust check would look for specific alert
        sleep 5 # Give time for processing
        FINAL_ALERT_COUNT=$(psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alerts;" | xargs)

        if [ "$FINAL_ALERT_COUNT" -gt "$INITIAL_ALERT_COUNT" ]; then
            echo "SUCCESS: New alert created in database."
            # Further check: LATEST_ALERT_TYPE=$(psql ... "SELECT alert_type FROM alerts ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;")
            # if [ "$LATEST_ALERT_TYPE" == "$EXPECTED_ALERT_TYPE" ]; then echo "Alert type matches."; else echo "Alert type mismatch"; fi
        else
            echo "FAILURE: No new alert created in database."
            exit 1
        fi
        # Add check for frame file existence in FRAMES_DIR
    else
        echo "FAILURE: Upload failed with HTTP status: $RESPONSE_CODE"
        exit 1
    fi
    ```
    *(This is a conceptual script. The actual one should be adapted with correct DB credentials or assume they are in the environment for psql).*

### 8.3 Comprehensive Verification Checklist

An evaluator or tester can use this checklist to verify the core functionality of the implemented pipeline:

| #   | Feature / Functionality                      | Verification Steps                                                                                                                                                              | Expected Outcome                                                                                                     | Status (Pass/Fail) | Notes |

## 9. Deployment to AWS EC2

This section details deploying the backend application (Node.js server and Python ML script) to an AWS EC2 instance.

### 9.1 EC2 Instance Launch and Configuration

1.  **Navigate to EC2 Console:**
    *   Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    *   Search for "EC2" and go to the EC2 dashboard.
2.  **Launch Instance:**
    *   Click "Launch instances".
    *   **Name and tags:** Give your instance a name (e.g., `anomaly-detection-server`).
    *   **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image - AMI):**
        *   Select an AMI. "Ubuntu Server" (e.g., 22.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS) is recommended. Choose an `x86_64` or `arm64` architecture depending on your preference (ensure software compatibility if choosing ARM). Free Tier eligible AMIs are marked.
    *   **Instance type:**
        *   Select a Free Tier eligible instance type (e.g., `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` if `t2.micro` is not available in your region for new accounts).
        *   *Note:* For running YOLOv5, `t2.micro` / `t3.micro` might be slow due to limited CPU/RAM. Processing times for videos will be longer. For better performance, a more powerful instance (e.g., `t3.medium` or a CPU-optimized instance) would be needed, but this would incur costs.
    *   **Key pair (login):**
        *   Create a new key pair or choose an existing one. If creating new:
            *   Provide a key pair name (e.g., `my-ec2-key`).
            *   Choose key pair type (RSA) and format (.pem for OpenSSH).
            *   Click "Create key pair". The `.pem` file will download. **Store this file securely; it's essential for SSH access.**
    *   **Network settings:**
        *   Click "Edit".
        *   **VPC:** Select your desired VPC (usually default).
        *   **Subnet:** Choose a subnet (no preference for a single instance usually).
        *   **Auto-assign public IP:** Set to "Enable". This gives the EC2 instance a public IP address to access it from the internet.
        *   **Firewall (security groups):**
            *   "Create security group" or "Select existing security group".
            *   Name it descriptively (e.g., `anomaly-server-sg`).
            *   **Inbound security groups rules:**
                *   **Rule 1 (SSH):**
                    *   Type: `SSH`
                    *   Protocol: `TCP`
                    *   Port range: `22`
                    *   Source type: `My IP` (for secure access only from your IP) or `Anywhere IPv4` (0.0.0.0/0 - less secure, use with caution). For evaluation, providing reviewers with a temporary `Anywhere` rule might be necessary if their IPs are unknown, or updating it to their IPs.
                *   **Rule 2 (HTTP for Backend):**
                    *   Type: `Custom TCP`
                    *   Protocol: `TCP`
                    *   Port range: `3001` (or whatever port your backend Node.js server will listen on, as defined in `backend/.env`).
                    *   Source type: `Anywhere IPv4` (0.0.0.0/0) so the frontend can access it. If using Nginx on port 80, then add a rule for port 80 instead or additionally.
                *   **(Optional) Rule 3 (HTTPS):** If you plan to set up HTTPS with Nginx, add a rule for port `443`.
            *   *Important Note:* The EC2 instance's security group (`anomaly-server-sg`) must be allowed to access the RDS instance on port 5432. This was configured in the RDS security group's inbound rules (Section 6.4.2), where you added `anomaly-server-sg` as a source.
    *   **Configure storage:**
        *   Free Tier eligible instances usually come with up to 30 GB of EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3) storage. The default (e.g., 8GB or 10GB) might be sufficient, but consider increasing it if you expect to store many frames or have large Python dependencies. 20-30GB is safer.
    *   **Advanced details:** Default settings are usually fine.
3.  **Launch instance:** Click "Launch instance". It will take a few minutes to initialize.

### 9.2 Connecting to the EC2 Instance

1.  **Get Public IP Address:**
    *   In the EC2 console, select your instance.
    *   Note the "Public IPv4 address".
2.  **SSH into the Instance:**
    *   Open your terminal or an SSH client.
    *   Ensure your `.pem` key file has the correct permissions:
        ```bash
        chmod 400 /path/to/your/my-ec2-key.pem
        ```
    *   Connect using SSH:
        ```bash
        ssh -i /path/to/your/my-ec2-key.pem ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
        ```
        (Replace `ubuntu` with `ec2-user` if you chose an Amazon Linux AMI. For Ubuntu AMIs, the user is `ubuntu`).
        Confirm the connection when prompted.

### 9.3 Server Environment Setup

Once connected to your EC2 instance via SSH, install necessary software:

1.  **Update Package Lists:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
2.  **Install Git:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git -y
    ```
3.  **Install Node.js and npm:**
    *   It's recommended to install a specific Node.js version (e.g., 18.x or 20.x) using NodeSource or NVM (Node Version Manager).
    *   **Using NodeSource (example for Node.js 20.x):**
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
        ```
        Verify installation: `node -v` and `npm -v`.
4.  **Install Python, pip, and venv:**
    *   Ubuntu Server AMIs usually come with Python 3. Verify: `python3 --version`.
    *   Install pip and venv if not present:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv -y
        ```
5.  **Install PM2 (Process Manager for Node.js):**
    ```bash
    sudo npm install pm2 -g
    ```
6.  **(Optional) Install Nginx (if using as a reverse proxy):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nginx -y
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    sudo systemctl enable nginx # Start Nginx on boot
    ```
    Verify Nginx by navigating to your EC2's public IP in a browser; you should see the Nginx welcome page.

### 9.4 Application Deployment

1.  **Clone Your Project Repository:**
    On the EC2 instance, navigate to a suitable directory (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/` or `/var/www/`) and clone your project:
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/ # Or your preferred location
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd anomaly-detection-system/
    ```
2.  **Set up Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the `backend/` directory: `cd backend/`
    *   **Create `.env` file:**
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        Edit `backend/.env` using a terminal editor like `nano` or `vim`:
        ```bash
        nano .env
        ```
        **Crucially update:**
        *   `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` to your RDS details.
        *   `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH` may need to be `python3` or the full path to python3 within a venv you set up on EC2.
        *   Other paths if your deployment structure differs from local.
    *   **Set up Python Virtual Environment and Dependencies (inside `backend/python/`):**
        ```bash
        cd python/
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        deactivate # Optional, PM2 can be configured to use the venv
        cd .. # Back to backend/
        ```
        Ensure `backend/.env`'s `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH` points to `/home/ubuntu/anomaly-detection-system/backend/python/venv/bin/python3` or similar.
    *   **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
3.  **Set up Frontend (Build static files):**
    The frontend is a React SPA. For deployment, you need to build the static files.
    *   Navigate to the `frontend/` directory: `cd ../frontend/` (if in `backend/`)
    *   **Create `.env` file (if needed for build time, or configure Nginx to serve with correct API URL):**
        The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/.env` should be set to your EC2 public IP or domain name and backend port, e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3001/api`.
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        nano .env # Update VITE_API_BASE_URL
        ```
    *   **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   **Build the Frontend:**
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
        This will create a `dist/` directory in `frontend/` containing the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These files can be served by Nginx or another web server. For simplicity in this project, direct access to the Node.js backend is assumed unless Nginx is explicitly configured. The minimal frontend can run locally, pointed at the deployed EC2 backend. If you want to serve the frontend from EC2, you'd typically use Nginx.

### 9.5 Running the Application with PM2

PM2 will manage your Node.js backend process.

1.  **Navigate to the `backend/` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/anomaly-detection-system/backend/
    ```
2.  **Create a PM2 Ecosystem File (Optional but Recommended):**
    Create a file named `ecosystem.config.js` in the `backend/` directory:
    ```bash
    nano ecosystem.config.js
    ```
    Add the following configuration:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      apps: [{
        name: 'anomaly-backend', // Application name
        script: 'server.js',    // Script to be run
        cwd: __dirname,         // Set current working directory to script's directory
        watch: false,           // Disable watch mode for production (or configure carefully)
        env: {                  // Environment variables (can also be sourced from .env by Node.js app)
          NODE_ENV: 'production',
          // You can define other env vars here, but .env file is often preferred
        },
        // If using Python venv and .env does not specify absolute path:
        // interpreter_args: "--experimental-modules", // If using ES modules in server.js
        // You might need to ensure the Python script is executable and has the correct shebang
        // or PM2 uses a shell that has the venv activated.
        // Easiest is setting PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH in .env to the venv's python.
      }]
    };
    ```
3.  **Start the Application with PM2:**
    *   If using `ecosystem.config.js`:
        ```bash
        pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
        ```
    *   Alternatively, to start `server.js` directly:
        ```bash
        pm2 start server.js --name anomaly-backend
        ```
4.  **Check Application Status:**
    ```bash
    pm2 list
    pm2 logs anomaly-backend # Or logs for all: pm2 logs
    ```
    Look for any errors.
5.  **Save PM2 Process List (to restart on server reboot):**
    ```bash
    pm2 save
    pm2 startup # This will output a command to run to enable startup script
    # Execute the command output by `pm2 startup` (e.g., sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu)
    ```

### 9.6 (Optional) Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

If you want to use Nginx (e.g., to serve on port 80, handle SSL, serve static frontend files):

1.  **Configure Nginx:**
    Create a new Nginx server block configuration:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/anomaly-app
    ```
    Add a configuration like this (adjust as needed):
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name <EC2_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DOMAIN>; # Your EC2's public IP or domain

        location /api/ { # Proxy backend API requests
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3001/; # Assuming Node.js runs on port 3001
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }

        # To serve static frames directly via Nginx (more efficient)
        location /frames/ {
            alias /home/ubuntu/anomaly-detection-system/backend/frames/;
            expires 7d; # Optional: set cache expiration for frame images
            autoindex off;
        }

        # To serve the built frontend static files
        location / {
            root /home/ubuntu/anomaly-detection-system/frontend/dist;
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }

        # Access and error logs (optional but good for debugging)
        access_log /var/log/nginx/anomaly-app.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/anomaly-app.error.log;
    }
    ```
2.  **Enable the Site and Test Nginx Configuration:**
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/anomaly-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    sudo nginx -t # Test configuration
    ```
    If `nginx -t` reports success:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```
3.  **Update Frontend `.env`:** If using Nginx on port 80, the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/.env` (before building or if served via dev server pointed at prod) should be `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DOMAIN>/api`.
4.  **Security Group:** Ensure your EC2 security group allows inbound traffic on port 80 (and 443 if using HTTPS).

### 9.7 Serving Anomaly Frames

*   **Current Method (Express Static Serve):**
    The Node.js backend (`server.js`) is configured to serve static files from the `backend/frames/` directory:
    ```javascript
    // In server.js
    app.use('/frames', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'frames')));
    ```
    This means if a frame is saved as `anomaly_123.jpg`, it can be accessed via `http://<EC2_IP>:3001/frames/anomaly_123.jpg`.
*   **Via Nginx (if configured, see above):** Nginx is more efficient for serving static files. If Nginx is set up as in 9.6, frames would be accessible via `http://<EC2_IP_OR_DOMAIN>/frames/anomaly_123.jpg`.

### 9.8 Final Checks and Health Verification

1.  **Access Application:**
    *   If not using Nginx: Open `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3001/api/health` in your browser. You should see the health check response.
    *   If using Nginx: Open `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/api/health`.
2.  **Test End-to-End:**
    *   Run your local frontend (`npm run dev` in `frontend/`) but ensure its `frontend/.env`'s `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to your EC2's public IP and the correct backend port/Nginx path (e.g., `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3001/api` or `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/api`).
    *   Perform an end-to-end test by uploading a video known to cause anomalies.
    *   Verify:
        *   Alert creation in the RDS database.
        *   Frame saved in `/home/ubuntu/anomaly-detection-system/backend/frames/` on EC2.
        *   Frame accessible via its URL.
        *   PM2 logs for any errors: `pm2 logs anomaly-backend`.

## 10. Addressing Original Project Requirements: Status & Theoretical Implementations

This section provides a meticulous review of each original project requirement as outlined in the assessment brief. It details the current implementation status within the "Barebones ML Pipeline" focused version of the project, provides rationale for any deviations or de-scoped features (primarily due to pragmatic focus on core functionality within the assessment timeline), and most importantly, offers **comprehensive theoretical implementation strategies** for those requirements not fully built out. This demonstrates both the practical execution of the core system and a thorough understanding of how to achieve the broader, original vision with production-quality considerations.

*(The subsections below correspond to the numbered requirements in the assessment document)*

### 10.1 Frontend Framework (Req 1.1)

*   **Requirement:** Use Angular or React to implement the GUI. If React is chosen, TypeScript (.ts / .tsx) must be used.
*   **Current Status: Fully Implemented.**
    *   The project uses **React (v18.x)** for the frontend Graphical User Interface (GUI).
    *   **TypeScript (v5.x)** is utilized consistently throughout the frontend codebase (e.g., `.tsx` for components, `.ts` for type definitions, service logic, and theme configuration). This choice ensures static type-checking, leading to improved code quality, early error detection, enhanced maintainability, and better developer tooling (e.g., autocompletion, refactoring).
    *   The frontend development environment and build process are managed by **Vite (v5.x)**, chosen for its fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.
    *   Key libraries integrated within this React/TypeScript ecosystem include:
        *   **Material-UI (MUI) (v5.x):** For UI components (as per Requirement 1.2).
        *   **Axios (v1.x):** For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
    *   This implementation directly and fully satisfies Requirement 1.1.

### 10.2 Frontend GUI (Req 1.2)

*   **Requirement:**
    *   Implement:
        *   A search page with search criteria filters and results table.
        *   A modal dialog for displaying detailed anomaly alerts (see `GUI.png` for reference).
    *   Use Material-UI (MUI).
    *   Provided UI HTML files may be used as a base.
    *   UI sophistication is not required — focus on core logic.
*   **10.2.1 Current Status (Minimal UI - Aligned with Pivoted Scope)**
    *   **MUI Usage: Implemented.** Material-UI (MUI) is used for all components in the existing minimal frontend (e.g., `Button`, `Box`, `Typography`, `LinearProgress`, `Alert` in `UploadSection.tsx`; `ThemeProvider`, `CssBaseline` in `main.tsx`; custom theme in `theme.ts`).
    *   **Core Logic Focus & Upload UI:** The guideline "UI sophistication is not required — focus on core logic" was central to the pivoted strategy. A functional, albeit minimal, UI for the core task of **video upload** (Requirement 1.6) has been implemented using MUI. This directly enables interaction with and testing of the backend ML pipeline.
    *   **Search Page & Modal Dialog: De-scoped (Pivoted).** The implementation of a full "search page" with filters and results table, and the "modal dialog" for detailed anomaly alerts, were intentionally de-scoped in this "Barebones ML Pipeline" version. This decision allowed concentrated effort on ensuring the robustness and successful deployment of the end-to-end video processing and alert generation workflow, which was deemed more critical for demonstrating core ML integration capabilities within the assessment timeframe.
    *   **Provided UI HTML Files:** The provided HTML files (`Main_Page.html`, `Alert_Detail_Page.html`) were carefully reviewed and served as conceptual references for the visual layout and data points expected in a more complete UI, informing the theoretical design below.

*   **10.2.2 Theoretical Implementation: Full Frontend GUI (Search Page & Alert Detail Modal)**
    Should this project be extended to realize the original vision for the frontend GUI, the following detailed strategy, adhering to production-quality principles, would be implemented:

    *   **A. Conceptual Overview & User Experience Goals:**
        The full GUI would transform the system into a usable operational tool. The "Search Page" would serve as a dashboard where users can query, filter, sort, and review historical anomaly alerts. The "Modal Dialog" would provide an in-depth view of a specific alert, critically including the associated visual evidence (the anomaly frame). The UI would be designed to be intuitive, responsive, and provide clear feedback to the user.

    *   **B. Core React Components (TypeScript & MUI):**
        1.  **`AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` (New Page Component):**
            *   **Role:** The main container component for the search and results view.
            *   **State Management:** Would manage overall state for search filters, fetched alert data (paginated), loading indicators, error messages, selected alert for the modal, and modal visibility. React Context API with `useReducer` or a lightweight state manager like Zustand would be employed to manage this complex state efficiently and avoid excessive prop drilling.
            *   **Lifecycle:** On mount, it would likely fetch an initial set of recent alerts.
        2.  **`AlertFilters.tsx` (New Component):**
            *   **Role:** Encapsulates all search filter inputs.
            *   **MUI Components:** Would utilize `TextField` (for keyword search in messages/details), `Select` (for `alert_type`), MUI X `DateRangePicker` (for `timestamp` filtering), and `Button` ("Apply Filters", "Clear Filters").
            *   **Interaction:** On filter changes, it would call callback functions provided by `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` to update filter state, which would then trigger a new API request. Debouncing would be applied to keyword search to avoid excessive API calls on every keystroke.
        3.  **`AlertsTable.tsx` (New Component):**
            *   **Role:** Displays the paginated list of alerts retrieved from the backend.
            *   **MUI Components:** `Table`, `TableContainer`, `TableHead`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`, `TableCell`, `TableSortLabel` (for column sorting), `TablePagination`.
            *   **Columns:** ID, Timestamp (formatted), Alert Type, Message (truncated), Details (e.g., person count), Action (a "View Details" button).
            *   **Interaction:** Clicking sort headers would update sorting state in `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` and re-fetch data. Pagination controls would trigger API calls for different pages. Clicking "View Details" would trigger the modal.
            *   **Data Handling:** Would gracefully handle empty states ("No alerts found for your criteria") and loading states (e.g., display MUI `Skeleton` loaders or `CircularProgress`).
        4.  **`AlertDetailModal.tsx` (New Component - based on original GUI.png):**
            *   **Role:** Displays comprehensive details of a single selected anomaly alert.
            *   **MUI Components:** `Dialog`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogContent`, `DialogContentText`, `DialogActions`, `Button`, `Grid` (for layout), `Typography`, `CardMedia` or `<img>` for the frame.
            *   **Content:**
                *   **Alert Metadata:** ID, Time (formatted), Type, Full Message.
                *   **Structured Details:** The content of the `details` JSONB field (e.g., detected count, confidence, frame number) would be presented in a readable format, perhaps using MUI `List` or `Chip` components for key-value pairs.
                *   **Supporting Frame Image:** An `<img>` tag or MUI `CardMedia` would display the anomaly frame. The `src` attribute would be the URL constructed to fetch the frame from the backend (e.g., `/frames/<frame_storage_key>` or a pre-signed S3 URL). Would include loading indicators for the image and error handling (e.g., placeholder if image fails to load).
            *   **Interaction:** Opened/closed by state managed in `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx`. "Close" button within the modal.
        5.  **`UploadSection.tsx` (Existing - Integration):**
            *   This existing component could either be:
                *   Integrated directly into the `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` layout (e.g., as an expandable section or a separate tab).
                *   Remain accessible via a separate navigation link.
            *   Upon successful upload and anomaly detection by the backend, a mechanism (e.g., a toast notification, an event bus, or state refetch) would inform the `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` to potentially update the `AlertsTable.tsx`.

    *   **C. API Service Layer (`services/alertApiService.ts` - New Module):**
        *   **Role:** Centralize all frontend API interactions related to alerts.
        *   **Functionality:** Contain Axios-based functions for:
            *   `fetchAlerts(params: AlertQueryParameters): Promise<PaginatedAlertsResponse>`: Fetches a list of alerts based on filter, sort, and pagination parameters. `AlertQueryParameters` and `PaginatedAlertsResponse` would be defined interfaces.
            *   `fetchAlertById(id: string | number): Promise<ApiAlertData>`: Fetches a single alert's full details.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, transforming Axios errors into a consistent error format for UI components to consume.

    *   **D. Data Flow for Search & Display:**
        1.  User interacts with `AlertFilters.tsx`.
        2.  Filter state in `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` is updated via callbacks.
        3.  `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` calls `alertApiService.fetchAlerts` with current filters/pagination.
        4.  Loading state is set; `AlertsTable.tsx` might show spinners.
        5.  `alertApiService` makes an Axios GET request to `/api/alerts` (new backend endpoint).
        6.  Backend processes the request (queries RDS, applying filters/pagination).
        7.  Backend returns paginated alert data and total count.
        8.  Axios promise resolves; `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` updates its alert list state.
        9.  `AlertsTable.tsx` re-renders with the new alerts.
        10. User clicks "View Details" on an alert in the table.
        11. `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx` sets the `selectedAlertId` and `isModalOpen = true`.
        12. `AlertDetailModal.tsx` (if not pre-fetching data) might then call `alertApiService.fetchAlertById(selectedAlertId)` or receive the full alert object directly as a prop. The image URL is constructed (e.g., `/frames/<frame_storage_key>`).
        13. Modal displays detailed information and the frame image.

    *   **E. Backend API Endpoints Required (New):**
        *   **`GET /api/alerts`:**
            *   **Purpose:** Retrieve a list of alerts with support for filtering, sorting, and pagination.
            *   **Query Parameters:**
                *   `page` (e.g., `1`): Current page number.
                *   `limit` (e.g., `10`): Number of items per page.
                *   `sortBy` (e.g., `timestamp`): Column to sort by.
                *   `sortOrder` (e.g., `asc`, `desc`): Sort direction.
                *   `alertType` (e.g., `Multiple_Persons_Detected`): Filter by type.
                *   `startDate`, `endDate` (ISO 8601 format): Filter by timestamp range.
                *   `searchKeyword`: Full-text search across `message` and potentially `details`.
            *   **Response:** A JSON object like `{ data: [Array<AlertSummary>], totalItems: number, currentPage: number, totalPages: number }`.
        *   **`GET /api/alerts/:id`:**
            *   **Purpose:** Retrieve full details for a single alert by its ID.
            *   **Response:** A JSON object for the alert, including the `frame_storage_key` and the full `details` JSONB. *Crucially, if using S3 for frames, this endpoint would be responsible for generating and returning a pre-signed URL for the frame image as part of the response.*

    *   **F. State Management Considerations:**
        *   For the search filters, result list, pagination, loading state, and modal visibility, a robust state management solution would be chosen. Options:
            *   **React Context API + `useReducer`:** Suitable for moderately complex state localized to the alerts dashboard.
            *   **Zustand/Jotai:** Lightweight global state managers if state needs to be accessed or modified from more disparate parts of the application (e.g., if other components need to trigger alert list refreshes).
            *   Avoid Redux unless the application's state complexity truly warrants it, due to its boilerplate.

    *   **G. Key UX Considerations:**
        *   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the table and modal are usable on various screen sizes.
        *   **Loading States:** Clear visual indicators (e.g., MUI `Skeleton`, `CircularProgress`) during API calls.
        *   **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for API failures or invalid filter combinations.
        *   **Accessibility (a11y):** Proper ARIA attributes for tables, modals, and interactive elements. Keyboard navigability.
        *   **Performance:** Optimize frontend rendering. Debounce text inputs for filtering. Efficient data fetching with pagination.

    *   **Benefits:** This full GUI would provide a valuable interface for monitoring and investigating security alerts, significantly enhancing the system's operational utility and directly addressing the full scope of Requirement 1.2.

### 10.3 Backend Framework (Req 1.3)

*   **Requirement:** Use Node.js for backend services. Deploy backend on AWS EC2.
*   **Current Status: Fully Implemented.**
    *   The backend is architected using **Node.js (v18.x)** and the **Express.js (v4.x)** framework for creating RESTful API services.
    *   The complete backend application (Node.js server, Python environment, and ML model) has been successfully **deployed and verified on an AWS EC2 instance** (Ubuntu, typically `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` for this project's scale). Process management on EC2 is handled by **PM2**.
    *   Deployment details, including EC2 setup, dependency installation, PM2 configuration, and security group settings, are documented in Section 9 of this README.

### 10.4 Backend Storage (Req 1.4)

*   **Requirement:** Use AWS RDS to store anomaly alert data. Implement decoupled CRUD operations. Provide a reasonable solution for storing frame data.
*   **10.4.1 AWS RDS & Current Frame Data Solution (Implemented)**
    *   **AWS RDS:** **Fully Implemented.** The system utilizes an **AWS RDS instance running PostgreSQL (v14.x+)** for persistent storage of structured anomaly alert data. The `alerts` table schema (defined in `db_schema.sql`) includes fields for `id`, `timestamp`, `alert_type`, `message`, `frame_storage_key`, and a JSONB `details` field for flexible metadata. The `backend/db.js` module manages the connection pool and query execution.
    *   **Frame Data Storage Solution (Current): Implemented (Basic, Local EC2 Storage).** In the current iteration, anomaly frames (JPEG images) are stored directly on the **local filesystem of the AWS EC2 instance** within the `backend/frames/` directory. These files are served statically by the Express.js application (via `app.use('/frames', express.static(...))`) or could be served by Nginx if configured. This approach fulfills the "reasonable solution for storing frame data" for the pivoted scope, allowing visual verification of anomalies.
    *   **Decoupled CRUD Operations (Current Status): Partially Implemented.**
        *   **Create:** The primary "Create" operation for alerts is intrinsically part of the ML processing pipeline. When the Python script detects an anomaly and outputs valid JSON, the `POST /api/upload` handler in `server.js` parses this and inserts a new record into the `alerts` table. This demonstrates the "C" in CRUD for alert generation.
        *   **Read, Update, Delete (RUD): Not Implemented.** Dedicated RESTful API endpoints for general reading (listing, filtering, fetching by ID), updating, or deleting alert records (independent of the ML pipeline) are not part of the current "barebones" implementation. The focus was on the generation and initial persistence of alerts.

*   **10.4.2 Theoretical Implementation: Full Decoupled CRUD Operations & S3 for Frame Storage**
    To achieve fully decoupled CRUD and a more robust, scalable frame storage solution:

    *   **A. Full CRUD for Alerts (Backend API Expansion):**
        *(This sub-section would reuse and potentially expand on the detailed theoretical implementation for full CRUD previously discussed, covering `routes/alertRoutes.js`, `controllers/alertController.js`, `services/alertService.js`, specific SQL for GET/PUT/DELETE, dynamic query building, input validation, authorization, and pagination. Key is emphasizing the decoupling of these management APIs from the ML pipeline's alert creation.)*
        *   **Enhanced Rationale for Decoupling:** Decoupling these CRUD APIs from the ML detection pipeline is crucial for system maintainability and extensibility. It allows for:
            *   **Administrative Interfaces:** Admins or other systems can manage alerts (e.g., mark as resolved, add notes, delete false positives) without re-processing videos.
            *   **Independent Data Consumption:** Other services or analytics tools can consume alert data via stable Read APIs without needing to understand the ML pipeline.
            *   **System Evolution:** The ML pipeline can evolve independently of how alerts are managed or viewed.

    *   **B. Upgrading Frame Storage to AWS S3 (Recommended Production Solution):**
        1.  **Conceptual Overview:** AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) is the ideal solution for storing binary objects like image frames due to its high durability, availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This would replace storing frames on the EC2 instance's local disk.
        2.  **Modifications to Python Script (`detect.py`):**
            *   **AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):** The `boto3` library would be added to `python/requirements.txt` and imported in `detect.py`.
            *   **S3 Upload Logic:** When an anomaly frame is generated (after `cv2.imwrite` to a temporary local path or directly from memory buffer):
                *   An S3 client would be initialized (`boto3.client('s3')`).
                *   The frame image would be uploaded to a designated S3 bucket (e.g., `anomaly-frames-bucket`) with a unique object key (e.g., `YYYY/MM/DD/frame_<uuid>.jpg` or `YYYY/MM/DD/<original_video_name_hash>/frame_<framenum>_<timestamp>.jpg`). A structured key prefix strategy aids organization.
                *   The Python script's JSON output would then include this S3 object key as the `frame_storage_key`.
            *   **IAM Permissions for EC2:** The EC2 instance running the backend would need an IAM Role attached with a policy granting it `s3:PutObject` permissions for the target S3 bucket. This is more secure than embedding AWS credentials in the script or environment variables on EC2 for S3 access.
        3.  **Modifications to Backend (`server.js` / `alertController.js`):**
            *   When saving an alert to RDS, the `frame_storage_key` would now be the S3 object key.
            *   **Frame Access (for the theoretical full UI):**
                *   **Option 1 (Pre-signed URLs - Recommended):** When the frontend requests an alert's details (e.g., via `GET /api/alerts/:id`), the backend would use the AWS SDK (`aws-sdk` for Node.js or Boto3 if a Python microservice handled this) to generate a short-lived, secure S3 pre-signed GET URL for the frame associated with the `frame_storage_key`. This URL would be included in the API response. The frontend `<img>` tag would then use this pre-signed URL directly as its `src`. This avoids exposing the S3 bucket publicly and provides fine-grained, temporary access. The EC2 instance's IAM Role would also need `s3:GetObject` permissions.
                *   **Option 2 (Backend as Proxy - Less Ideal for S3):** The backend could have an endpoint that streams the S3 object. This adds load to the backend but can obscure S3 details. Pre-signed URLs are generally better.
        4.  **Benefits of S3 for Frames:**
            *   **Scalability:** Virtually unlimited storage capacity.
            *   **Durability & Availability:** S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability.
            *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Typically cheaper than EBS storage for large volumes of static data.
            *   **Decoupling:** Frame storage is independent of EC2 instance lifecycle.
            *   **Lifecycle Management:** S3 supports lifecycle policies to automatically archive or delete old frames (e.g., move to S3 Glacier for long-term, cheaper storage).
            *   **Integration:** Easier integration with other AWS services (e.g., AWS Lambda for further processing of new frames, AWS Rekognition for additional image analysis, Amazon CloudFront for CDN delivery).

### 10.5 Machine Learning Integration (Req 1.5)

*   **Requirement:**
    *   Integrate pretrained YOLO (object detection) and optionally LSTM (behavior analysis).
    *   Use samples from the Stanford Drone Dataset.
    *   Deploy models in-browser using WebAssembly (WASM) or WebGPU.
    *   Focus is not on model accuracy — use off-the-shelf pretrained models.
*   **10.5.1 YOLO Integration (Implemented - Backend)**
    *   **Implemented:** A pretrained **YOLOv5 model** (specifically `yolov5s.pt` from Ultralytics) is successfully integrated for object detection. The model is loaded via `torch.hub` within the Python script (`backend/python/detect.py`) and runs on the **backend EC2 instance**. This leverages an off-the-shelf, high-quality pretrained model, aligning perfectly with the requirement "Focus is not on model accuracy."
    *   The choice of `yolov5s` offers a good balance between inference speed and accuracy suitable for a general-purpose object detection task on resource-constrained environments like a `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` EC2 instance (though processing times are noted to be longer on such instances).

*   **10.5.2 LSTM for Behavior Analysis (Optional Requirement - Not Implemented)**
    *   **Current Status: Not Implemented.** The optional integration of an LSTM for behavior analysis was not pursued in the "barebones" version to maintain focus on the core object detection and alert generation pipeline.
    *   **Detailed Theoretical Implementation Strategy:** *(This sub-section would reuse and significantly expand upon the previously detailed theoretical strategy for LSTM, including a more in-depth look at:)*
        1.  **Specific Anomaly Behaviors to Target:** (e.g., Loitering defined as an object remaining within a specific ROI for > N seconds; Fighting detected by rapid, erratic movements of multiple closely located 'person' objects; Intrusion by tracking an object crossing a predefined virtual line or entering a restricted polygon ROI).
        2.  **Advanced Object Tracking Algorithm Choices:** Discussion of pros/cons of DeepSORT (robust but heavier), FairMOT (joint detection & tracking), or ByteTrack (good balance) vs. simpler Kalman/centroid methods. Justify choice based on expected accuracy vs. computational cost.
        3.  **Feature Engineering for LSTM:** More examples of feature vectors: relative object positions, interaction metrics (e.g., distance between pairs of people), optical flow characteristics within bounding boxes, time-series of bounding box aspect ratios. Normalization techniques (e.g., min-max scaling, z-score normalization for features).
        4.  **LSTM Architecture Details:** Specifics like number of LSTM layers, hidden units per layer, use of `Bidirectional` LSTMs, `TimeDistributed` Dense layers for sequence-to-sequence tasks, dropout rates for regularization. Choice of activation functions (e.g., `tanh` for LSTM internal gates, `softmax` for classification output). Loss functions (e.g., `categorical_crossentropy` for classification, `mean_squared_error` for autoencoders). Optimizers (e.g., Adam).
        5.  **Training Data Pipeline (More Detail for SDD):** How to segment sequences from the Stanford Drone Dataset, extract tracks, generate feature vectors, and label them for supervised LSTM training (or define criteria for "normal" if using unsupervised LSTM autoencoders). Discuss data augmentation for sequences (e.g., time warping, adding noise to trajectories).
        6.  **Real-time Inference Considerations:** Strategies for managing state for ongoing tracks and feeding feature sequences to the LSTM model in a streaming fashion rather than batch processing entire videos.
        7.  **Alert Generation & Interpretation:** How LSTM output translates into actionable alerts (e.g., "Loitering detected for object ID X at location Y for Z seconds"). How to correlate LSTM-based behavior alerts with YOLO-based object detection alerts.

*   **10.5.3 Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) (Resource - Not Directly Integrated for Training/Testing)**
    *   **Current Status: Not Implemented.** While aware of SDD and its relevance, specific video samples from it were not programmatically integrated for training new models or systematically evaluating the current YOLOv5 setup due to the pivoted scope. Generic test videos were used to verify pipeline functionality.
    *   **Detailed Theoretical Utilization Strategy:** *(Expand upon previous, detailing how SDD's specific annotation structure (`frame_number`, `track_id`, `object_type`, `xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax`, etc.) would be parsed and used for:)*
        1.  **Quantitative YOLO Evaluation:** Calculating mAP, precision, recall against SDD's ground truth bounding boxes for relevant object classes to benchmark the chosen YOLOv5 model on this specific type of aerial imagery.
        2.  **Data Source for Tracker Training/Evaluation:** If a learning-based tracker was chosen, SDD's tracks are ideal training data. For any tracker, they provide ground truth for metrics like MOTA, MOTP, IDF1.
        3.  **Behavioral Annotation & LSTM Dataset Creation:** A methodology for researchers or annotators to overlay SDD videos with labels for specific complex behaviors (e.g., "person running suddenly", "vehicle stopped in unauthorized zone", "group converging suspiciously"), thus creating a bespoke dataset for training a supervised LSTM for behavior analysis. This involves temporal labeling of track segments.

*   **10.5.4 In-Browser ML (WASM/WebGPU) (Requirement - Not Implemented in Core Pipeline)**
    *   **Current Status: Not Implemented.** All ML inference currently executes on the backend server (AWS EC2). Deploying models in-browser was deferred due to the complexity of model conversion, frontend performance considerations, and the focus on a server-centric pipeline for this iteration.
    *   **Detailed Theoretical Implementation Strategy:** *(Expand substantially upon the previous explanation, focusing on a production-minded approach:)*
        1.  **Choice of Target In-Browser Runtime & Model Format:**
            *   **Recommendation:** **ONNX Runtime Web** with WASM (for CPU compatibility) and WebGPU (for high-performance GPU execution where available). ONNX is a well-supported interchange format.
            *   **Alternatives:** TensorFlow.js (also good, but ONNX Runtime Web is often more performant for a wider range of ONNX models).
        2.  **Model Conversion & Optimization Pipeline:**
            *   **From PyTorch (YOLOv5) to ONNX:** Detail the exact `torch.onnx.export()` parameters for YOLOv5, including `opset_version` (e.g., 11-13 for good compatibility), `dynamic_axes` (for variable batch size and input image dimensions), and handling of custom layers or operations if any.
            *   **ONNX Model Optimization:** Use tools like `onnx-simplifier` to simplify the graph. Crucially, apply **quantization** (e.g., dynamic quantization to INT8, or static quantization if a calibration dataset is available) to significantly reduce model size and potentially speed up inference, especially on CPU/WASM. Tools like Olive (from Microsoft) or Intel's OpenVINO Model Optimizer (if targeting specific hardware/OpenVINO.js) could be used.
        3.  **Frontend ML Orchestration Service/Hook (React):**
            *   Create a custom React hook (e.g., `useYOLOv5Inference(modelPath, options)`) or a service class to manage:
                *   Loading the ONNX model (`ort.InferenceSession.create(modelPath)`).
                *   Initializing the ONNX Runtime Web execution providers (WASM, WebGPU).
                *   Managing model state (loaded, error).
                *   Handling video input (from `<video>` element frames or webcam stream).
                *   Encapsulating preprocessing logic (resizing to model input, normalization, `NCHW` tensor creation from `ImageData`) in JavaScript/TypeScript.
                *   Running inference (`session.run(feeds)`).
                *   Encapsulating postprocessing logic in JavaScript (decoding YOLO output tensors into bounding boxes, scores, class IDs; applying Non-Max Suppression - potentially using a WASM-compiled NMS for speed).
        4.  **User Experience for In-Browser ML:**
            *   Clear indication of model loading progress.
            *   Feedback if WebGPU is unavailable and falling back to WASM (slower).
            *   Mechanism for users to select video source (upload file, webcam).
            *   Displaying results overlaid on video/canvas.
        5.  **Performance Benchmarking & Trade-offs:** Compare FPS achieved via WebGPU vs. WASM vs. WebGL on target devices. Discuss trade-offs (e.g., larger model on server = higher server cost but consistent perf; smaller/quantized model in browser = lower server cost, user privacy, but variable perf and initial load).
        6.  **Security & Business Logic:** How to handle sensitive anomaly rules if detection logic also moves client-side. Option to send *detections* to backend for rule application vs. full client-side decision.

### 10.6 Anomaly Detection System Core (Req 1.6)

*   **Requirement:**
    *   Users must be able to upload video clips via the web app.
    *   Implement anomaly detection with custom rules.
    *   Upon detection, create an alert with: timestamp, alert\_type, message, frame, details.
*   **Current Status: Core Functionality Fully Implemented.** This section forms the heart of the "Barebones ML Pipeline" deliverable.
    *   **Video Upload:** Implemented via the React frontend (`UploadSection.tsx`) and the Node.js backend (`POST /api/upload` using `multer`). Robust handling of file data.
    *   **Custom Rules:** A clear, albeit simple, custom rule ("person count > threshold") is implemented within `backend/python/detect.py`. This rule is applied to the post-processed object detection results from YOLOv5. The system is designed such that `detect.py` could be extended with more complex rules or a rule engine.
    *   **Alert Creation:** Fully implemented. When an anomaly is detected by the Python script:
        *   **Timestamp:** The `alerts` table in PostgreSQL has a `timestamp` column with `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, automatically recording the time of alert insertion. The `details` JSONB in the alert also includes `timestamp_ms` (from video start) and `frame_number` from the Python script for precise event timing within the video.
        *   **Alert Type:** `detect.py` generates an `alert_type` string (e.g., "High Count: person") based on the rule triggered. This is stored in RDS.
        *   **Message:** `detect.py` generates a descriptive `message` string detailing the anomaly (e.g., "Detected 3 'person' objects, exceeding limit of 2."). This is stored in RDS.
        *   **Frame:** `detect.py` saves the specific video frame where the anomaly was detected as a JPEG image. The unique `frame_filename` is passed back to the Node.js backend and stored in the `frame_storage_key` column in RDS. This frame is currently stored on the EC2 instance's local filesystem in `backend/frames/`.
        *   **Details:** `detect.py` generates a structured JSON object for the `details` field, containing context-specific information like `detected_count`, `target_class`, `confidence_threshold` used, etc. This is stored as JSONB in RDS, allowing for flexible querying and future expansion of details without schema changes.
    The current implementation provides a complete, traceable record for each detected anomaly, linking the alert metadata directly to the visual evidence (frame) and specific detection parameters.

### 10.7 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 10.7.1 Unit Testing (Req 2.1)

*   **Requirement:** Use Jest. Target 80%+ code coverage.
*   **Current Status: Partially Addressed / Strategically Pivoted.**
    *   **Jest Integration:** Jest is included as a development dependency in both `backend/package.json` (for potential use with Supertest) and `frontend/package.json` (for potential use with React Testing Library). The basic project structure to support Jest tests (`__tests__` folders, `jest.config.js` if needed) is implicitly available. `npm test` scripts are placeholders in `package.json`.
    *   **80%+ Code Coverage Goal: Not Achieved.** The creation of a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to meet the 80%+ code coverage target was **intentionally de-scoped** in favor of focusing development effort on establishing and verifying the end-to-end functionality of the core ML pipeline for this "barebones" iteration. Current system validation primarily relies on manual end-to-end testing, the `test_pipeline_detailed.sh` script for backend API checks, and static code analysis via ESLint.
*   **Detailed Theoretical Implementation Strategy for Achieving 80%+ Coverage:**
    *(This sub-section would reuse and significantly expand upon the previously detailed theoretical testing strategy, potentially adding specific examples of Jest/RTL/Supertest test cases for key functions/components/endpoints within the current "barebones" scope. E.g., for `server.js`: test file upload route with mock Python spawn success/failure; for `UploadSection.tsx`: test file selection, button clicks, and status updates with mock API calls.)*
    1.  **Define Test Strategy for Each Module:**
        *   **Backend API (`server.js`):** Integration tests with Supertest. Test successful uploads, Python script success/failure paths, error responses (400, 500). Mock `db.query` and `child_process.spawn`.
        *   **Database Module (`db.js`):** Unit tests. Mock `pg.Pool` to ensure `query` function handles client acquisition/release correctly, and that it correctly passes SQL and params. Test connection error handling within `checkConnection`.
        *   **Python Script (`detect.py`):** Unit tests with `unittest` or `pytest`.
            *   Mock `cv2.VideoCapture` to feed known image frames or simple NumPy arrays.
            *   Mock `torch.hub.load` to return a mock model that outputs predictable detection DataFrames for given inputs.
            *   Test `check_anomaly_rules` function with various detection inputs.
            *   Test `save_frame` by mocking `cv2.imwrite` and checking call parameters.
            *   Test JSON output generation logic.
            *   Test argument parsing and error handling for invalid inputs.
        *   **Frontend (`UploadSection.tsx`, `App.tsx`):** Unit/Integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library (RTL).
            *   `UploadSection`: Render component, simulate file selection (`fireEvent.change`), simulate button clicks (`fireEvent.click`). Mock the `onUploadSubmit` prop to return resolved (success/no anomaly) or rejected (error) promises. Verify that UI elements (status `Alert`, `LinearProgress`, button states) update correctly based on these mock outcomes.
            *   `App.tsx`: Render component. Since its main logic is `handleUploadSubmit`, this could be unit tested by extracting it (if it becomes more complex) or tested indirectly through `UploadSection` by mocking `axios.post`. Mock `axios.post` to test the `handleUploadSubmit`'s success and error paths, ensuring it returns/throws correctly for `UploadSection` to consume.
    2.  **Set up Coverage Reporting:** Configure Jest to generate coverage reports (`jest --coverage`). Use `istanbul` reporters (e.g., `lcov`, `text`, `html`).
    3.  **Iterative Test Writing:** Add tests for critical paths first. Review coverage reports to identify gaps. Prioritize testing:
        *   Conditional logic (if/else, switch).
        *   Error handling paths (`try/catch`).
        *   Complex data transformations.
        *   Interactions with external dependencies (which should be mocked).
    4.  **Achieving 80%+:** This is an iterative process of writing tests, running coverage, identifying gaps, and writing more tests. It requires discipline. Code may need refactoring to improve testability (e.g., breaking down large functions).

#### 10.7.2 Code Quality (Req 2.2)

*   **Requirement:** Pass all ESLint checks.
*   **Current Status: Fully Implemented.**
    *   ESLint is configured and operational for both the `backend` (Node.js/JavaScript, using `eslint-config-standard` and related plugins, ESLint v8) and `frontend` (React/TypeScript, using `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` with Vite's generated `eslint.config.js` flat config style, ESLint v9).
    *   The codebase has been consistently linted (`npm run lint` in respective directories), and all reported issues (including `verbatimModuleSyntax` related type-only import requirements) have been addressed to ensure adherence to the defined coding standards and catch potential issues.

#### 10.7.3 AWS Implementation (Req 2.3)

*   **Requirement:** Use a free AWS trial account. Provide access credentials to reviewers for verification.
*   **Current Status: Fully Implemented.**
    *   The project's cloud components (AWS EC2 for the application server, AWS RDS for the PostgreSQL database) have been provisioned using configurations **eligible for the AWS Free Tier**. This ensures that evaluation and development can proceed without incurring unexpected costs, provided usage stays within Free Tier limits.
    *   As detailed in Section [12](#12-verification-for-evaluators-aws-credentials) of this README, secure and appropriate mechanisms are in place to provide reviewers with temporary, **strictly read-only AWS IAM user credentials**. This facilitates thorough verification of the deployed cloud infrastructure.

## 11. Vibe Coding and AI-Assisted Development (Req 3.0)

*(This section content is retained from your provided detailed input, as it was already comprehensive. It details the AI-assisted development workflow.)*

*   **Requirement:**
    *   Candidates to go with a vibe coding workflow using AI tools instead of writing all code manually.
    *   Suggested tools: Roo-code, Any LLM-powered IDE (e.g., VS Code with Copilot-like extensions).
    *   May use public/free LLM APIs like NVIDIA Build: LLaMA 3.3 Nemotron Super 49B.
    *   Evaluation focus: Effective interaction with LLMs, logical prompt engineering, adherence to design patterns, diagnostic/debugging skills with AI-generated code.
*   **Current Status: Fully Implemented & Documented.**
    *   This project was developed with a "vibe coding" workflow, extensively utilizing AI-assisted development tools conceptually aligned with services like GitHub Copilot and direct interactions with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). While specific tools like "Roo-code" or "NVIDIA Build: LLaMA 3.3 Nemotron Super 49B" were not explicitly integrated by name, the development process mirrored the philosophy of leveraging state-of-the-art AI for code generation, refinement, debugging, and architectural brainstorming.
    *   The types of prompts used and the iterative nature of AI interaction involved:
        *   **Boilerplate Generation:** For `package.json`, ESLint/Vite/TS configs, basic Express server structure, React component shells. This saved significant time on repetitive setup tasks.
        *   **Core Logic Drafting:** For database connection modules (`db.js`), initial versions of `server.js` upload/orchestration logic (including child process spawning and stream handling), Python `detect.py` structure (OpenCV video loop, YOLOv5 model loading, basic anomaly rule), and frontend component logic (`UploadSection.tsx` form handling and API calls). This provided a strong foundation to build upon.
        *   **Configuration Assistance:** For AWS setup steps (RDS creation, EC2 instance types, Security Group rule syntax), PM2 commands and `ecosystem.config.js` structure.
        *   **Debugging and Error Resolution:** Using LLMs to interpret cryptic error messages (e.g., Node.js `pg` client SSL connection issues with RDS, ESLint version conflicts, Python dependency issues), suggest potential causes, and propose fixes. This significantly sped up troubleshooting.
        *   **Code Refinement & Best Practices:** Asking for improvements to error handling (e.g., `try-catch` blocks, promise rejections), ways to make code more modular (e.g., extracting functions), secure (e.g., parameterized queries, temporary file handling), or to align with specific design patterns.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** A key aspect was iterative prompt engineering. Initial broad prompts yielded starting points. These were then refined with more specific constraints (e.g., "using Express.js middleware", "ensure the Python script outputs JSON to stdout"), error contexts from actual execution, or requests for alternative approaches ("what's another way to handle asynchronous operations here?"). This demonstrates logical prompt engineering and an understanding of how to guide AI to produce desired, high-quality outputs relevant to the project's technical stack and requirements.
    *   **Diagnostics & Refinement:** AI-generated code was **never blindly accepted**. It was always critically reviewed for correctness, efficiency, and security. The generated code was then tested thoroughly, debugged (often with further AI assistance to understand issues in AI's own suggestions), and refactored to ensure it met project requirements, adhered to design principles (like decoupling, evident in the `db.js` module or the separation of Python processing), and was free of logical flaws or unintended side effects. This diagnostic skill and iterative refinement loop are crucial when working effectively with AI-generated code.
    *   A more detailed log of specific prompts and their evolution would ideally be kept in a `prompts.md` file as part of a formal submission process (as per a potential requirement 4 for prompt logging, though not explicitly asked to produce here). The entire development process, particularly in setting up complex integrations like AWS RDS, the backend-Python bridge, Nginx configuration, and troubleshooting initial connectivity and dependency issues, heavily relied on and showcases effective interaction and debugging within an AI-assisted ("vibe coding") workflow.

Below are illustrative examples of prompt categories and types of assistance sought during development, demonstrating the nature of the AI interaction:

*   **Initial Setup and Boilerplate Generation:**
    *   *Query Example:* "Draft a `package.json` for a Node.js Express backend targeting Node.js v18. Include dependencies: `express`, `pg` for PostgreSQL, `dotenv`, `cors`, `multer`. Dev dependencies: `nodemon`, `eslint`, `eslint-config-standard`, `jest`, `supertest`. Add a `start` script for `node server.js` and a `dev` script for `nodemon server.js`."
    *   *Query Example:* "Generate a foundational `.eslintrc.json` for a Node.js project using CommonJS modules, targeting ES2021, extending `eslint-config-standard`. Configure it to also work with Jest tests." (Follow-up Example: "ESLint reports 'X is not defined' for Jest globals like `describe` and `test`. How do I configure ESLint to recognize Jest globals?")
    *   *Query Example:* "Provide a comprehensive `.gitignore` template for a full-stack Node.js/React project, including common OS files, IDE directories, `node_modules`, `.env` files, build outputs like `dist/`, and log files."
    *   *Query Example:* "Outline a React functional component `UploadSection.tsx` using TypeScript and Material-UI. It should include an MUI `Button` for file selection (triggering a hidden file input), another `Button` for upload, and a `Typography` or `Alert` component to display status messages (uploading, success, error)."
*   **Core Logic and Algorithm Stubbing/Drafting:**
    *   *Query Example:* "Create a Node.js module `db.js` using the `pg` library. It should initialize a connection pool using environment variables `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PORT`. Include a `query(text, params)` function that acquires a client from the pool, executes the query, and releases the client in a `finally` block. Also, add an async function to test the database connection on startup and log success or failure." (Follow-up Example: "How should I handle SSL configuration for connecting to AWS RDS PostgreSQL, specifically the `rejectUnauthorized` option, using environment variables?")
    *   *Query Example:* "Develop an Express.js route handler for `POST /api/upload`. Use `multer` for single video file upload (field name 'video'). After receiving the file, save it temporarily. Then, spawn a Python script `python/detect.py`, passing the video file path and a `frames_output_dir` path as arguments. Capture `stdout` (expected to be JSON) and `stderr` from the Python script. If `stdout` contains valid JSON, parse it and use values like `alert_type`, `message`, `frame_storage_key`, `details` to insert a record into a 'alerts' table using a `db.query` function. Log script errors from `stderr`. Ensure the temporary video file is deleted after processing, regardless of success or failure."
    *   *Query Example:* "Write a Python script `detect.py` that takes two command-line arguments: `input_video_path` and `output_frames_dir`. The script should:
        1.  Load a pretrained 'yolov5s' model using `torch.hub.load`.
        2.  Open the input video using `cv2.VideoCapture`.
        3.  Iterate through video frames (process every 10th frame to speed up).
        4.  For each processed frame, perform object detection. Filter detections for 'person' class with confidence > 0.5.
        5.  If the number of detected persons is greater than 1, consider it an anomaly.
        6.  If an anomaly is detected:
            a.  Construct a unique filename for the frame image (e.g., including timestamp and person count).
            b.  Save the current frame to `output_frames_dir` using `cv2.imwrite`.
            c.  Create a JSON object: `{'alert_type': 'Multiple_Persons_Detected', 'message': f'{count} persons detected.', 'frame_storage_key': 'saved_frame_filename.jpg', 'details': {'person_count': count}}`.
            d.  Print this JSON object to standard output.
        7.  Print any processing logs or errors to standard error."
*   **Configuration and AWS Interaction:**
    *   *Query Example:* "List the detailed steps to create an AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance through the AWS Management Console, specifically using the 'Free Tier' template. Highlight settings for 'Public access', VPC Security Group (initial creation), and 'Initial database name'."
    *   *Query Example:* "Provide an example of an AWS EC2 Security Group inbound rule configuration (Terraform or console steps) to allow PostgreSQL traffic (port 5432) only from another specific Security Group ID (e.g., the EC2 instance's SG)."
    *   *Query Example:* "Generate the shell commands to install Node.js v20.x using NodeSource, Python 3.10, pip, venv, PM2 globally via npm, and Nginx on an Ubuntu 22.04 EC2 instance."
*   **Debugging Assistance and Error Explanation:**
    *   *Error Message Context:* "My Node.js application on EC2 cannot connect to AWS RDS. The error is `timeout expired`. I've set RDS public access to 'Yes', and the RDS security group allows inbound on 5432 from 0.0.0.0/0. The EC2 instance's outbound security group rules allow all traffic. What else could be wrong?" (This could lead to discussing NACLs, correct endpoint usage, or `DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` issues if error message was more SSL specific).
    *   *Code Snippet & Error Query Example:* "This Python code for YOLOv5 inference (`[snippet]`) throws `RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory`. I'm running it on a t2.micro. How can I reduce memory usage or what are my options?"
*   **Refinement and Best Practices:**
    *   *Code Review Query Example:* "Review this Express.js route handler for file uploads (`[code snippet]`). How can I improve its error handling, particularly for asynchronous operations involving file system access and child process communication? Also, suggest a more robust way to ensure temporary files are always cleaned up."
    *   *Architectural Query Example:* "For a system that processes uploaded videos and generates alerts, what are the pros and cons of invoking a Python ML script as a child process from Node.js versus using a message queue and dedicated worker services for the ML part? Consider scalability and fault tolerance."

## 12. Verification for Evaluators (AWS Credentials)

To facilitate the verification of the deployed AWS infrastructure components (EC2 instance and RDS database), temporary, **read-only** AWS IAM user credentials will be provided securely and separately to the evaluators.

**What to Verify with Provided Credentials:**

Using these credentials with the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI, evaluators can inspect:

1.  **EC2 Instance (`anomaly-detection-server` or similar name):**
    *   **Instance State:** Verify it is "running".
    *   **Instance Type:** Confirm it matches the specified type (e.g., `t2.micro`, `t3.micro`).
    *   **Public IPv4 Address:** Note this address for accessing the deployed application.
    *   **Security Groups:** Inspect the inbound rules of the security group attached to the EC2 instance. Verify rules for SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 3001 for the backend, or 80 if Nginx is used), and any other necessary ports.
    *   **AMI:** Confirm the OS (e.g., Ubuntu).
2.  **RDS Database Instance (`anomaly-db-instance` or similar name):**
    *   **Status:** Verify it is "Available".
    *   **Engine:** Confirm it is PostgreSQL and the version.
    *   **Instance Class:** Confirm it matches the Free Tier selection (e.g., `db.t3.micro`).
    *   **Connectivity & Security Tab:**
        *   **Endpoint & Port:** Note these values.
        *   **Public Accessibility:** Confirm it is set to "Yes" (as per setup for this project's scope).
        *   **VPC Security Groups:** Inspect the inbound rules of the security group associated with the RDS instance. Verify it allows PostgreSQL traffic (port 5432) from the EC2 instance's security group ID and/or your current IP if you intend to connect directly for schema verification.
    *   **Configuration Tab:** Check the initial database name (e.g., `anomaly_system_db`).
3.  **(Optional) IAM User Permissions:** Evaluators can check the permissions associated with the provided IAM user to confirm they are indeed read-only and scoped appropriately.

**Security and Credential Handling:**

*   The provided IAM credentials will have a **custom policy attached granting only read-only access** to relevant services (EC2, RDS, potentially CloudWatch Logs for viewing application logs if set up).
*   These credentials are **temporary** and will be **disabled and deleted** after the evaluation period.
*   Evaluators are requested to handle these credentials securely and not share them.
*   **No sensitive data from the application (like passwords within `.env` files) will be exposed via these IAM credentials.** Application secrets are managed within the EC2 instance environment.

This approach allows for thorough verification of the cloud infrastructure deployment while maintaining security best practices.

## 13. Key Decisions, Trade-offs, and Project Evolution Summary

The development of this Anomaly Detection System involved a series of critical architectural decisions and strategic trade-offs. These were primarily driven by the overarching objective to deliver a demonstrably functional core Machine Learning (ML) pipeline within the assessment's constraints, while concurrently showcasing a comprehensive understanding of the requirements for a broader, more feature-rich, and production-grade system.

**Project Evolution - Strategic Pivot to a Core ML Pipeline:**

*   **Initial Vision & Comprehensive Scope:** The project was initially conceived with the ambition to implement a full-spectrum anomaly detection system. This encompassed a sophisticated frontend with advanced search, filtering, and detailed alert visualization capabilities; a backend supporting full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for alerts; integration of advanced ML models possibly including LSTMs for temporal behavior analysis and exploring in-browser ML deployment via WASM/WebGPU; and adherence to stringent non-functional requirements such as achieving over 80% unit test coverage with Jest. This initial comprehensive vision aimed to fully address all specified functional and non-functional requirements, creating a holistic solution ready for immediate, wider operational use.
*   **Strategic Pivot & Rationale:** In recognizing the substantial timeline, resource allocation, and inherent complexities associated with realizing the full vision within the defined assessment period, a strategic decision was made to pivot the development focus. This pivot concentrated efforts on architecting, implementing, and deploying a robust, end-to-end **core ML pipeline**. This refined scope prioritized the following critical deliverables:
    1.  A reliably functional and user-friendly (albeit minimal) video upload mechanism via a React/TypeScript/MUI frontend.
    2.  Successful and verifiable integration of the YOLOv5 object detection model, executed via a well-structured Python script.
    3.  Robust backend orchestration of this ML pipeline using Node.js and Express.js, ensuring efficient inter-process communication.
    4.  Durable and queryable persistent storage of detected anomaly alerts in an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database instance.
    5.  Successful deployment of this integrated core system onto an AWS EC2 instance, making it publicly accessible for evaluation.
*   **Rationale for Pivot Justification:** This focused approach ensured that a tangible, technically sound, and working system demonstrating the most intricate ML integration aspects could be delivered and thoroughly evaluated. It consciously prioritized **depth and reliability in the core data processing flow** (upload -> ML analysis -> alert/frame persistence -> feedback) over a broader array of peripheral features that might have been implemented more superficially. This deliberate choice allows for a clearer assessment of foundational engineering skills in designing and integrating complex, multi-component systems.

**Key Technical Decisions & Resulting Trade-offs:**

1.  **Backend ML Integration Strategy (Node.js invoking Python via `child_process`):**
    *   **Decision:** Employ `child_process.spawn` within the Node.js/Express.js backend to execute the Python ML script (`detect.py`) as a separate operating system process. Communication relies on standard I/O streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) for passing parameters (video path, output directories) and retrieving results (JSON from stdout, logs/errors from stderr).
    *   **Trade-off Analysis:**
        *   **Pros:**
            *   **Implementation Simplicity (for current scale):** Relatively straightforward to implement for a single-server, moderate-load scenario, allowing for rapid prototyping and demonstration of the core ML integration.
            *   **Leveraging Python's ML Ecosystem:** Directly utilizes Python's rich libraries (PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLOv5 specific utilities) without needing complex cross-language bindings or re-implementing ML logic in Node.js.
            *   **Non-Blocking Node.js Event Loop:** Spawning Python as a separate process ensures that the computationally intensive ML inference tasks do not block the Node.js event loop, allowing the API server to remain responsive to other incoming requests (e.g., health checks, future UI interactions).
            *   **Process Isolation:** Failures within the Python script (e.g., an unhandled exception during model inference) are less likely to crash the entire Node.js backend server process directly, though robust error handling in Node.js for child process failures is still essential.
        *   **Cons:**
            *   **Scalability Limitations:** This model does not scale well horizontally. If video processing load increases, the single Node.js server managing child processes becomes a bottleneck. Each `spawn` consumes server resources.
            *   **Resilience & Fault Tolerance:** Less resilient than distributed architectures. If the Node.js server crashes, ongoing Python processes might be orphaned or terminated abruptly. There's no built-in retry mechanism for Python script failures beyond what's custom-coded in Node.js.
            *   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Complexity:** Managing data transfer via stdin/stdout/stderr (especially for larger data payloads or structured error reporting beyond simple strings) requires careful serialization (e.g., JSON strings) and parsing, and can be more error-prone and less type-safe than dedicated API contracts (HTTP/RPC) or message schemas in a queue-based system. Debugging IPC issues can also be challenging.
            *   **Resource Management on EC2:** Efficiently managing CPU/Memory for both the Node.js process and multiple concurrent Python child processes on a single EC2 instance (especially a `t2.micro`/`t3.micro`) can be difficult and may lead to resource contention.
        *   **Strategic Consideration & Future Direction:** For a production system intended for higher throughput or greater reliability, a decoupled microservices architecture employing message queues (e.g., AWS SQS for simplicity, RabbitMQ/Kafka for more complex scenarios) and dedicated Python worker services (e.g., running on separate EC2 instances with Auto Scaling, AWS Fargate, or even AWS Lambda for suitable video segment processing) would be the strongly preferred approach. This is further detailed in Section 14: Future Improvements. The current implementation serves as a foundational proof-of-concept for the ML interaction.

2.  **Frame Storage Solution (Local EC2 Filesystem):**
    *   **Decision:** Anomaly frames (JPEG images generated by `detect.py`) are stored in a dedicated directory (`backend/frames/`) on the AWS EC2 instance's local filesystem (likely an EBS volume). These frames are then served statically by the Express.js application.
    *   **Trade-off Analysis:**
        *   **Pros:**
            *   **Simplicity for Core Demonstration:** This is the simplest method to implement for proving the end-to-end pipeline where an anomaly detection event results in tangible visual evidence being saved and accessible.
            *   **Low Latency for Backend Access:** Reading/writing local files is very fast for the Python script and the Node.js server (if it needed to re-access them, though currently it just serves them).
        *   **Cons:**
            *   **Lack of Scalability:** Storage capacity is limited by the size of the EC2 instance's EBS volume. If many anomalies with large frames are generated, disk space can be exhausted quickly.
            *   **Durability Risks:** Data stored on a single EBS volume is not as durable as dedicated object storage. While EBS volumes are persistent across instance reboots (if configured correctly), they are susceptible to AZ failures or accidental volume deletion if not properly backed up via snapshots. Frames would be lost if the EC2 instance or its volume were catastrophically terminated without a robust backup strategy.
            *   **Efficiency for Serving:** Serving static files through a Node.js/Express application is less efficient than using a dedicated web server like Nginx or a CDN for content delivery, especially under load.
            *   **Statelessness Violation:** Storing application data (frames) on the application server itself makes the server stateful, complicating scaling (new instances wouldn't have old frames) and instance replacement.
        *   **Strategic Consideration & Future Direction:** **AWS S3 is the unequivocal industry-standard solution for this use case.** Migrating frame storage to S3 (as detailed in Section 10.4.2 and Section 14) is a critical next step for any production-grade evolution. This would involve creating S3 buckets, modifying the Python script to use `boto3` to upload frames, storing S3 object keys in RDS, and having the backend generate S3 pre-signed URLs for secure, temporary frontend access, thereby leveraging S3's scalability, durability, and cost-efficiency.

3.  **Frontend UI Design (Minimal Upload Interface):**
    *   **Decision:** Implement a minimal React/TypeScript/MUI frontend focused exclusively on the video upload functionality and displaying basic success/error/processing status messages via MUI `Alerts`.
    *   **Trade-off Analysis:**
        *   **Pros:**
            *   **Allowed Focused Effort:** Enabled concentrated development on the complex backend, ML integration, database setup, and AWS deployment, which were core to demonstrating the pipeline.
            *   **Met Core Upload Requirement:** Directly fulfilled the assessment requirement (1.6) for users to upload video clips via a web app.
            *   **Faster Iteration on Core Pipeline:** Simpler UI meant less time spent on frontend development, allowing for quicker testing and refinement of the backend components.
        *   **Cons:**
            *   **Limited User Utility:** The current UI lacks the rich features for alert review and management (search, filtering, detailed view with frame image) specified in the original scope (Req 1.2). This significantly limits its immediate operational utility for users needing to investigate or analyze detected anomalies beyond a simple upload confirmation.
            *   **No Data Visualization:** No ability to see historical trends, frequency of alert types, or the actual visual evidence (frame) associated with an alert directly within the application.
        *   **Strategic Consideration & Future Direction:** The comprehensive theoretical design for the full UI, including `AlertsDashboardPage.tsx`, `AlertFilters.tsx`, `AlertsTable.tsx`, and `AlertDetailModal.tsx` (as detailed in Section 10.2.2), demonstrates a clear understanding of how to expand the frontend to meet the original vision, leveraging MUI components and appropriate state management strategies.

4.  **Unit Testing Coverage (Strategic De-scoping):**
    *   **Decision:** Prioritize manual End-to-End (E2E) testing of the core pipeline and basic script-based verification (`test_pipeline_detailed.sh`) over achieving the stipulated high unit test coverage (80%+ with Jest).
    *   **Trade-off Analysis:**
        *   **Pros:**
            *   **Freed Development Time:** Allocated significant development resources towards successfully building, integrating, and deploying the complex, multi-component core functional pipeline (frontend upload -> backend orchestration -> Python ML -> RDS persistence -> EC2 deployment).
            *   **Demonstrated E2E Functionality:** Ensured the primary use case was verifiably working from user input to data storage.
        *   **Cons:**
            *   **Reduced Regression Safety Net:** The lack of a comprehensive automated unit/integration test suite means future code changes, refactoring, or addition of new features carry a higher risk of introducing unintended regressions in existing functionality. Manual E2E testing is more time-consuming and less repeatable for catching such issues early.
            *   **Lower Adherence to Non-Functional Requirement:** Did not meet the explicit 80%+ coverage NFR.
            *   **Documentation through Tests:** Well-written unit tests also serve as a form of executable documentation for individual modules and functions; this benefit is currently limited.
        *   **Strategic Consideration & Future Direction:** The project has Jest installed and configured in both frontend and backend `package.json` files, and placeholder `npm test` scripts. The detailed theoretical strategy for achieving high coverage using Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest (for backend APIs), and Python's `unittest`/`pytest` (for the ML script) is outlined in Section 10.7.1. Implementing these tests would be a critical step for moving towards a more production-ready and maintainable system.

5.  **YOLOv5 Model Selection (`yolov5s.pt`):**
    *   **Decision:** Utilize a pretrained `yolov5s` (small) model variant loaded via PyTorch Hub.
    *   **Trade-off Analysis:**
        *   **Pros:**
            *   **Readily Available & Easy Integration:** `yolov5s.pt` is widely accessible and straightforward to load using `torch.hub`, aligning with the "use off-the-shelf pretrained models" and "focus is not on model accuracy" guidelines.
            *   **Good Speed/Accuracy Balance (General Purpose):** Offers a reasonable compromise between inference speed and detection accuracy for common objects, suitable for demonstrating the pipeline.
            *   **Resource Efficiency (Relative):** Compared to larger YOLOv5 variants (`m`, `l`, `x`) or other more complex models, `yolov5s` is less demanding on CPU and RAM, making it more feasible (though still potentially slow) to run on resource-constrained EC2 instances like `t2.micro`/`t3.micro` for evaluation purposes.
        *   **Cons:**
            *   **Lower Accuracy on Challenging Scenarios:** `yolov5s`, being the smallest model in the family, may exhibit lower detection accuracy (more false negatives or lower confidence scores) compared to larger variants, especially for small objects, occluded objects, objects at a distance, or in visually complex scenes (e.g., poor lighting, cluttered backgrounds).
            *   **Not Fine-Tuned:** The generic pretrained model is not fine-tuned on any specific dataset highly representative of the target operational environment (e.g., if used for particular types of surveillance). This means its performance on niche object classes or unique environmental conditions might be suboptimal. The effectiveness of the downstream anomaly rules is directly dependent on the quality of detections from this model.
        *   **Strategic Consideration & Future Direction:** For a production system targeting specific anomaly types or environments, fine-tuning `yolov5s` (or a larger variant like `yolov5m`) on a custom dataset (potentially incorporating samples from the Stanford Drone Dataset or proprietary data) would likely yield significant performance improvements. Furthermore, exploring even more specialized or recent object detection architectures could be considered based on specific accuracy and speed requirements.

6.  **Anomaly Rule Simplicity (Single Rule: Person Count Threshold):**
    *   **Decision:** Implement a single, straightforward anomaly rule in `detect.py` (e.g., if the count of "person" objects detected by YOLOv5 in a frame exceeds a hardcoded threshold like `> 1`).
    *   **Trade-off Analysis:**
        *   **Pros:**
            *   **Easy to Implement & Understand:** Simple to code and verify, effectively demonstrating the concept of applying business logic post-ML inference to flag events as anomalous.
            *   **Clear Demonstration of Pipeline Component:** Shows how raw ML detections can be translated into actionable alerts.
        *   **Cons:**
            *   **Limited Real-World Applicability:** Real-world security anomalies are often far more nuanced and complex than a simple object count. This rule would generate many false positives in normally crowded areas or miss subtle but critical events (e.g., loitering, unusual movement, object left behind).
            *   **Not Configurable:** The rule (target class "person", count threshold) is currently hardcoded in the Python script, making it inflexible for different scenarios or adjustments without code changes.
        *   **Strategic Consideration & Future Direction:** A production system would necessitate a significantly more sophisticated and configurable rule engine. This is a key area for future improvement (see Section 14), potentially involving:
            *   A database or configuration file for storing rules.
            *   Support for rules based on object location (Regions of Interest - ROIs), object interactions, temporal patterns (requiring object tracking and possibly LSTMs), object speed, size changes, etc.
            *   A user interface for administrators to define and manage these rules.

**Evolution Summary:**

The project, through a deliberate and pragmatic evolution, has successfully transitioned from an ambitious, wide-ranging specification to a focused, demonstrably functional, and technically sound core ML anomaly detection system. While certain advanced features and non-functional requirements like comprehensive unit testing were strategically deferred to meet the assessment's core objectives within the given timeline, the current implementation provides a robust and well-documented foundation. The detailed theoretical discussions and implementation strategies outlined for the de-scoped features (primarily in Section 10) are intended to showcase a comprehensive design thinking capability that extends beyond the current practical scope, thus addressing the original project objectives in a holistic manner. The consistent application of AI-assisted development methodologies ("vibe coding") was instrumental in accelerating prototyping, facilitating iterative refinement, and efficiently troubleshooting complex integrations encountered throughout this developmental journey. The resulting system effectively validates the core competency to design, build, integrate, and deploy an ML-integrated application.

## 14. Future Improvements & Potential Extensions (Beyond Original Scope)

*(Continue with your existing detailed Section 14, applying the "expand with specifics, challenges, integrations, impact" pattern for each bullet point if desired. For example, I will expand the first two points here to illustrate further.)*

Beyond fulfilling the original project requirements (theoretical implementations for which are detailed in Section 10), the system offers numerous avenues for future enhancements and extensions to create a more robust, scalable, feature-rich, and production-ready application:

*   **Advanced User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   **Description:** Implement a comprehensive and secure authentication system to manage user identities and control access to the application's functionalities. This would involve:
        *   **Identity Provider Integration:** Utilizing industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect. Consider integrating with established identity providers such as **Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito, or Keycloak**. Alternatively, implement a robust local JWT (JSON Web Token)-based authentication system with secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2), token refresh mechanisms, and secure token storage (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure cookies).
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Defining distinct user roles (e.g., `Administrator`, `Operator/Analyst`, `UploaderOnly`) with granular permissions. For example, `Administrators` might manage users and system configurations; `Operators` might view all alerts, manage their status, and access detailed logs; `UploaderOnly` might only be permitted to upload videos.
        *   **Implementation:** Backend API endpoints for user registration, login, logout, password management. Middleware in Express.js to protect routes based on authentication status and user roles. Frontend UI components for login forms, user profile management, and conditional rendering of features based on permissions.
    *   **Value & Impact:** Drastically enhances system security by ensuring only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive data and perform actions. Enables auditable user activity (see "User and System Auditing" below). Allows for personalized user experiences and dashboards tailored to roles. This is a foundational requirement for almost any production-grade multi-user application.
    *   **Key Challenges:** Securely managing user credentials and sessions, implementing RBAC logic correctly across frontend and backend, integrating with external IdPs, handling token lifecycle management (issuance, validation, refresh, revocation).
    *   **Integration:** Would require new database tables for users, roles, and permissions. Frontend and backend logic would be significantly updated.

*   **Real-time Video Stream Processing & Analysis:**
    *   **Description:** Evolve the system from batch processing of uploaded video clips to ingesting and analyzing live video streams from sources such as IP cameras (using RTSP or ONVIF protocols), webcams (via WebRTC from the browser), or drone feeds (potentially via RTMP or other streaming protocols). This involves:
        *   **Stream Ingestion Module:** A new backend component (or a separate service) capable of connecting to and decoding various video stream formats. Libraries like **FFmpeg** (callable from Node.js or Python), **GStreamer**, or specialized real-time streaming servers (e.g., Ant Media Server, OvenMediaEngine) could be employed.
        *   **Frame Buffering & ML Processing Adaptation:** The Python ML script (`detect.py` or a modified version) would need to process frames from a continuous buffer rather than a finite file. This requires careful management of frame queues, processing rates to keep up with the stream (or intelligent frame dropping), and state management for detections across time if using tracking.
        *   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Detected anomalies would trigger real-time events or notifications rather than just a database entry post-batch processing.
    *   **Value & Impact:** Transforms the system into a proactive, continuous monitoring solution, enabling immediate detection and response to anomalies as they happen. This is critical for live security surveillance, operational monitoring, and safety applications.
    *   **Key Challenges:** Handling network latency, jitter, and disconnections from video streams. Achieving low-latency processing for near real-time alerts. Managing the computational load of continuous ML inference on multiple streams (likely requiring more powerful EC2 instances or a distributed worker architecture). Synchronizing frame timestamps accurately. Ensuring robust error recovery for stream interruptions.
    *   **Integration:** Major architectural shift. Could require new microservices for stream ingestion and processing. Database schema for alerts might need to accommodate stream identifiers. Frontend would need UI elements for adding/managing stream sources and viewing live-ish alert feeds.
