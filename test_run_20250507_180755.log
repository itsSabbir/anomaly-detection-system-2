[18:08:12] [SUCCESS] Test Passed: API responded with success status (200).

[18:08:13] [INFO] Response Body (saved to test_response_body_20250507_180755.json):
{"message":"Video processed successfully, no anomalies detected (or no JSON output)."}
[18:08:13] [INFO] Interpretation: Status 200 suggests the video was processed successfully, but NO anomaly was detected according to the current rules OR the Python script output was invalid.
[18:08:13] [INFO] -> Check the response body message above.
[18:08:13] [INFO] -> Verify NO new frame image was saved in 'backend/frames/'.
[18:08:13] [INFO] -> Verify NO new record was added to the 'alerts' table in RDS.
[18:08:13] [INFO] For detailed processing steps and potential Python errors, check the backend server logs (e.g., 'backend_server.log' if you captured it).
